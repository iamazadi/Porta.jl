title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>The Hopf fibration is a fiber bundle with a two-dimensional sphere as the base space and circles as the fiber space. It is the geometrical shape that relates Einstein&#39;s spacetime to quantum fields. In this model, we visualize the Hopf fibration by first calculating its points via a bundle chart and then rendering the points in 3D space via stereographic projection. The projection step is necessary because the Hopf fibration is embedded in a four-space, yet it has only three degrees of freedom as a three-dimensional shape. The idea that makes this model more special and interesting than a typical visualization is the idea of <a href="http://drorbn.net/AcademicPensieve/Projects/PlanetHopf/">Planet Hopf</a>, due to Dror Bar-Natan (2010). So, if the base space is a two-dimensional sphere much like the skin of the globe, then we can model the Earth as a sphere and skin the horizontal sections of the bundle. Into the bargain, the Earth rotates about its axis every 24 hours. That spinning transformation of the Earth, together with the non-trivial product space of the Hopf bundle, can be encoded naturally into the visualization. It makes a lot of sense no matter how ridiculous, especially when we try to visualize differential operators in the Minkowski space-time and investigate the properties of spin-transformations. The following explains how the source code for generating animations of the Hopf fibration works (alternative views of Planet Hopf).</p><h2 id="Import-the-Required-Packages"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Import-the-Required-Packages">Import the Required Packages</a><a id="Import-the-Required-Packages-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Import-the-Required-Packages" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Begin by importing a few software packages for doing algebraic operations, working with files and graphics processing units. Besides <strong>Porta</strong>, we need to use three packages: <a href="https://github.com/JuliaIO/FileIO.jl">FileIO</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl">GLMakie</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/src/LinearAlgebra.jl">LinearAlgebra</a>. First, <code>FileIO</code> is the main package for IO and loading all different kind of files, including images and Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files. Second, interactive data visualizations and plotting in Julia are done with <code>GLMakie</code>. Finally, <code>LinearAlgebra</code>, as a module of the Julia programming language, provides array arithmetic, matrix factorizations and other linear algebra related functionality. However, through years of working with geometrical structures and shapes we have encapsulated certain mathematical computations and transformations into custom types and interfaces, which make up most of the functionalities of project Porta. In addition, we wrapped complicated computer graphics workflows inside custom types in order to increase the interoprability of our types with those of external packages such as GLMakie.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">import FileIO
import GLMakie
import LinearAlgebra
using Porta</code></pre><h2 id="Set-Hyperparameters"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Set-Hyperparameters">Set Hyperparameters</a><a id="Set-Hyperparameters-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Set-Hyperparameters" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>There are essential Hyperparameters that determine the complexity of graphics rendering as well as the position and orientation of a camera, through which we render a scene. Since the output of the model is an animation video, we need to set the figure size to 1920 by 1080 to have a full high definition window, in which the scene is located. Most of the shapes and objects that we put inside of the scene are two-dimensional surfaces. Therefore, the segmentation of most shapes requires two integer values for determining how much compute power and resolution we are willing to spend on the animation. Furthermore, the shape of a circle is the most common in our scenes because of the magic of complex numbers. It is known that using 30 segments results in smooth low-polygon circles. So for a two-dimensional sphere a 30 by 30 segmented two-surface should look good. Therefore, we set the segments equal to a multiple of 30, and less curvy shapes will look even better in consequence. But, an animation extends through time frame by frame and so we need to set the total number of frames. In this way, specifying the number of frames determines the length of the video. For example, 1440 frames make a one-minute video at 24 frames per second.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">figuresize = (1920, 1080)
segments = 120
frames_number = 1440</code></pre><p>A model means a complicated geometrical shape contained inside a graphical scene. Every model has a name to use as the file name of the output video. Here, we choose the name <code>planethopf</code> as we construct an alternative view of the <a href="http://drorbn.net/AcademicPensieve/Projects/PlanetHopf/">Planet Hopf</a> by Dror Bar-Natan (2010). Heinz Hopf in 1931 discovered a way to join circles over the skin of the globe. The discovery defines a fiber bundle where the base space is the spherical Earth and the fibers are circles. But, the circles are all mutually parallel and linked. Moreover, the Earth goes through a full rotation about the axis that connect the poles every 24 hours. So it is not surprising that the picture of a non-trivial bundle and the spinning of the base space coordinates (longitudes) makes for a ridiculous geometric shape. But, the surprising fact is that all of it is visualizable as a 3D object. Then, we use a dictionary that maps indices to names in order to keep track of boundary data on the globe and the name of each boundary as a sovereign country.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">modelname = &quot;planethopf&quot;
indices = Dict()</code></pre><p>The Hopf fibration, as a fiber bundle, has an inner product space. The inner product space is symmetric, linear and positive semidefinite. The last property means that the product of a point in the bundle with itself is always non-negative, and it is zero if and only if the point is the zero vector. The abstract inner product space allows us to talk about the length of vectors, the distance between two points and the idea of orthogonality between two vectors. A pair of vectors are orthogonal when they make a right angle with each other and as a consequence their product is equal to zero. For all <span>$u, v, v_1, v_2 \in V$</span> and <span>$\alpha, \beta \in \R$</span> the following are the properties of the abstract inner product space:</p><ul><li>Symmetric: <span>$&lt;u, v&gt; = &lt;v, u&gt;$</span></li><li>Linear: <span>$&lt;u, \alpha v_1 + \beta v_2&gt; = \alpha &lt;u, v_1&gt; + \beta &lt;u, v_2&gt;$</span></li><li>Positive semidefinite: <span>$&lt;u, u&gt; \geq 0$</span> for all <span>$u \in V with &lt;u, u&gt; = 0$</span> if and only if <span>$u = 0$</span></li></ul><p>Now, in order to skin the horizontal cross-sections of the bundle for visualization we need to start with a base point, which is denoted by <code>q</code>. At the tangent space of the base point <code>q</code>, the inner product space (a connection one-form) splits the tangent space of the bundle <span>$P$</span> at <code>q</code> into two subspaces: horizontal and vertical.</p><p><span>$T_q P = V_q P \bigoplus H_q P$</span></p><p>In terms of the connection, the two subspcaes are orthogonal. A <code>chart</code> is a four-tuple of real numbers to be used as a pair of closed intervals in the horizontal subspace. Then, using the exponential map one can travel in both horizontal and vertical directions and cover the whole bundle within the lengths of the chart intervals. Within the boundary of the chart and with an additional vertical coordinate (a gauge) we can define a tubular neighborhood of the base point <code>q</code>. The first two elements of the four-tuple <code>chart</code> give the interval along the first basis vector and the last two elements give the interval along the second basis vector. As for the third basis vector of the tangent space (the vertical subspace) we use a beginning and an ending <em>gauge</em>.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">q = Quaternion(ℝ⁴(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0))
chart = (-π / 4, π / 4, -π / 4, π / 4)</code></pre><p>Next, we define four scalars in order to provide different gauge transformations for whirls and base maps. For creating a clearer view we are going to slice up the Hopf fibers (circles) and set different values for their respective alpha channels. The names <code>θ1</code>, <code>θ2</code>, <code>θ3</code> and <code>θ4</code> are used to provide the fiber actions when we construct and update the shapes. 0.0 means no action whereas 2π means a full circle around a Hopf fiber. Looking at the values of these names we can see that a Hopf fiber will be cut into four quarters. We can make some quarters opaque and others see-through for better visibility.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">θ1 = 0.0
θ2 = π / 2
θ3 = float(π)
θ4 = 3π / 2</code></pre><p>The camera is a viewport trough which we see the scene. It is a three-dimensional camera and much like a drone it has six features to help position and orient itself in the scene. Accordingly, a three-vector in the Euclidean 3-space determins its position in the scene, another 3-vector specifies the point at which it looks at, and a third vector controls the up direction of the camera. The third 3-vector is needed because the camera can rotate through 360 degrees about the axis that connects its own position to the position of the subject. Using these three 3-vectors we control how far away we are from the subject, and how upright the subject is. </p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">eyeposition = normalize(ℝ³(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)) * π
lookat = ℝ³(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
up = normalize(ℝ³(1.0, 0.0, 0.0))</code></pre><p>Each of the <code>eyeposition</code>, <code>lookat</code> and <code>up</code> vectors are in the three-real-dimensional vector space ℝ³. The structure of the abstract vector space of ℝ³ includes: associativity of addition, commutativity of addition, the zero vector, the inverse element, distributivity Ι, distributivity ΙΙ, associativity of scalar multiplication, and the unit scalar 1. Also, the product space associated with ℝ³ is symmetric, linear and positive semidefinite (see <em>real3_tests.jl</em>). The same goes for the structure of 4-vectors in ℝ⁴ as we are going to encounter in this model. An abstract vector space <span>$\{V, F, +, .\}$</span> consists of four things:</p><ul><li>A set of vector-like objects <span>$V = \{u, v, ...\}$</span></li><li>A field <span>$F$</span> of scalar numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, or octonions (any one of the division algebras)</li><li>An addition operation <span>$+$</span> for elements of <span>$V$</span> that dictates how to add vectors: <span>$u + v$</span></li><li>A scalar multiplication operator <span>$.$</span> for scaling a vector by an element of the field</li></ul><p>An abstract vector space satisfies eight axioms. For all vectors <span>$u, v, w \in V$</span> and for all scalars <span>$\alpha, \beta \in F$</span> the following pri=operties are ture:</p><ol><li>Associativity of addition: <span>$u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$</span></li><li>Commutativity of addition: <span>$u + v = v + u$</span></li><li>There exists a zero vector <span>$0 \in V$</span> such that <span>$u + 0 = 0 + u = u$</span></li><li>For every <span>$u$</span> there exists an inverse element <span>$-u$</span> such that <span>$u + (-u) = u - u = 0$</span></li><li>Distributivity I: <span>$\alpha (u + v) = \alpha u + \alpha b$</span></li><li>Distributivity II: <span>$(\alpha + \beta) u = \alpha u + \beta u$</span></li><li>Associativity of scalar multiplication: <span>$\alpha (\beta u) = (\alpha \beta) u$</span></li><li>There exists a unit scalar <span>$1$</span> such that <span>$1u = u$</span></li></ol><p>Interestingly, if the field <span>$F$</span> is an Octonian number then the axiom of the commutativity of addition becomes false. The plan is to first load a geographic data set, then construct a few shapes, and animate a four-stage transformation of the shapes. Model versioning can be applied here using different stages. The transformations are subgroups of the Lorentz transformation in the Minkowski vector space 𝕍, which is a tetrad and origin point away from the Minkowski space-time 𝕄. Both 𝕍 and 𝕄 inherit the properties of the abstract vector space. See <em>minkowskivectorspace_tests.jl</em> and <em>minkowskispacetime_tests.jl</em> for use cases.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">totalstages = 4</code></pre><h2 id="Load-the-Natural-Earth-Data"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Load-the-Natural-Earth-Data">Load the Natural Earth Data</a><a id="Load-the-Natural-Earth-Data-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Load-the-Natural-Earth-Data" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Next, we need to load two image files: an image to be used as a color reference, and another one to be used as surface texture for sections of the Hopf bundle. This is the first example of using <code>FileIO</code> to load image files from hard drive memory. Both images are made with a software called <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>, which is is a geographic information system software that is free and open-source. But, the data comes from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth Data</a>. Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software. We downloaded the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_admin_0_countries.zip">Admin 0 - Countries</a> data file from the 1:10m Cultural Vectors link of the Downloads page. It is a large-scale map that contains geometry nodes and attributes.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">reference = FileIO.load(&quot;data/basemap_color.png&quot;)
mask = FileIO.load(&quot;data/basemap_mask.png&quot;)</code></pre><p>As for the image files, we paint the boundaries using the gemometry nodes, and add a grid to be able to visualize distortions of the Euclidean metric of the underlying surface. Therefore, the reference is the clean image from which we pick colors, whereas the mask has a grid and transparency for visualization purposes.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">attributespath = &quot;data/naturalearth/geometry-attributes.csv&quot;
nodespath = &quot;data/naturalearth/geometry-nodes.csv&quot;
countries = loadcountries(attributespath, nodespath)</code></pre><p>The geometry nodes of the data set consist of latitudes and longitudes of boundaries. But, geometry attributes feature various geographical, cultural, economical and geopolitical values. Of these features we only need the names and geographic coordinates. To not limit the use cases of this model, the generic function <code>loadcountries</code> loads all of the data features by supplying it with the file paths of attributes and nodes. Data versioning can be applied here using different file versions. The attributes and nodes files are comma-separated values.</p><p>At a high level of description, the process of loading boundary data is as follows: First, we use FileIO to open the attributes file. Second, we put the data in a <a href="https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl"><code>DataFrames</code></a> to have in-memory tabular data. Third, sort the data according to shape identification. Fourth, open the nodes file in a DataFrame. Fifth, group the attributes by the name of each sovereign country. Sixth, determine the number of attribute groups by calling the generic function <code>length</code>. Seventh, define a constant <code>ϵ = 5e-3</code> to limit the distance between nodes so that the computational complexity becomes more reasonable. Eighth, define a dictionary that has the keys: <code>shapeid</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>gdpmd</code>, <code>gdpyear</code>, <code>economy</code>, <code>partid</code>, and <code>nodes</code>. Finally, for each group of the attributes we extract the data corresponding to the dictionary keys and push them into array values.</p><p>Part of the difficulty with the data loading process is that each sovereign country may have more than one connected component (closed boundary). That is why we store part identifications as one of the dictionary keys. In this process, the part with the greatest number of nodes is chosen as the main part and is pushed into the corresponding array value. All of the array values are ordered and have the same length so that indexing over the values of more than one key becomes easier. Once the part ID of each country name is determined, we make a subset of the data frame related to the part ID and then extract the geographic coordinates in terms of latitudes and longitudes. In fact, we make a histogram of each unique part ID and count the number of coordinates. The part ID with the greatest number of coordinates is selected for creating the subset of the data frame. Next, the coordinates are transformed into the Cartesian coordinate system from the Geographic one.</p><p>Finally, we <code>decimate</code> a curve containing a sequence of coordinates by removing points from the curve that are farther from each other than the given threshold <code>ϵ</code>. It is a step to make sure that the boundary data has superb quality while managing the size of data for computation complexity. The generic function <code>decimate</code> implements the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm">Ramer–Douglas–Peucker</a> algorithm. It is an iterative end-point fit algorithm suggested by Dror Bar-Natan (2010) for this model. Since a boundary is modelled as a curve of line segments, we set a segmentation limit. But, the decimation process finds a curve that is similar in shape, yet has fewer number of points with the given threshold <code>ϵ</code>. In short, <code>decimate</code> recursively simplifies the segmented curve of a closed boundary if the maximum distance between a pair of discarding points is greater than <code>ϵ</code>. The <em>distance</em> between two abstract vectors is given by <span>$d(u, v) \equiv ||u - v|| = \sqrt{&lt;(u - v), (u - v)&gt;}$</span>.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">boundary_names = [&quot;United States of America&quot;, &quot;Antarctica&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Iran&quot;, &quot;Canada&quot;, &quot;Turkey&quot;, &quot;New Zealand&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Pakistan&quot;, &quot;Russia&quot;]</code></pre><p>As the boundary data is massive in number (248 countries) we need to select a subset for visualization. 10 countries selected from a linear space of alphabetically sroted names should be representative of the whole Earth. Then again, using only three distinct points in the 2-sphere one can infer the transformations from the sphere into itself. Also, Antarctica should be added due to its special coordinates at the south pole, to give the user a better sense of how bundle sections are expanded and distorted. As soon as we have the names of the selection, we can proceed with populating the dictionary of indices that relates the name of each country with the corresponding index in boundary data. Using the dictionary we can read the attributes of countries by giving just the name as argument.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">boundary_nodes = Vector{Vector{ℝ³}}()

In this model, the layout of the <code>Figure</code> (graphical window) is a single <code>Scene</code>, because we have been able to directly plot all of the information about the bundle geometry and topology inside the same scene. The figure is supplied with the hyperparameter <code>figuresize</code> that we define above. Then, we set a black theme to have black background around the window at the margins. Next, we instantiate a gray point light and a lighter gray ambient light. The lights together with the figure are then passed to <code>LScene</code> to construct our scene. We pass the symbol <code>:white</code> as the argument to the <code>background</code> keyword as it makes for the most visible scene.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">makefigure() = GLMakie.Figure(size = figuresize)

The Hopf map projects all of the points in a fiber to the corresponding point in the base space. Then, a section of the bundle is used to lift the base point from a local region of the point in the base space to a local region of the point in the fiber space. The base map is a two-dimensional surface representing a section of the bundle, which could be horizontal or non-horizontal. A horizontal section is the one that assigns to each point of the region the same amount of fiber group action <span>$SO(2)$</span>. Therefore, the tangent vectors at the points of a horizontal section, which is an open set, map to a vector with the same length via the Hopf map. A section is the map that in composition with the Hopf map yield the identity.</p><p>We define the fiber gourp action (circle <span>$S^1$</span>) as a 64-bit floating point number, because a horizontal cross-section uses the same scalar number for the entirety of its region. But, the region is parameterized by a two-dimensional chart. A chart can be thought of as a rectangle whose sides are at most π in length. However, the length of a great circle of the three-dimensional sphere is 2π and the maximum length of the chart sides is limited. In case we choose a bigger side length than π we run into the problem of wrapping around the same surface twice, the universal covering space, which is visually confusing. The Hopf bundle does not admit a global section anyway and if we tried to use an oversized chart then the coordinates wrap around the same 2-surface, resulting in a confusingly textured surface. After exponentiating the base point <code>q</code> in horizontal directions for a magnitude beyond π, the orientation of the surface reverses and a sharp twist of the surface happens.</p><p>The Hopf bundle is embedded in ℝ⁴, the real-four-dimensional space. The coordinates are defined as unit quaternions where the basis vectors are represented by the symmetry group of the rotations of an orthogonal tetrad, namely <span>$SO(4)$</span>. vectors <span>$u$</span> and <span>$v$</span> are orthogonal if and only if their inner product equals zero <span>$&lt;u, v&gt; = 0$</span>. When we talk about the fiber action and bundle charts, we talk about values that are used in the Lie algebra of <span>$so(4)$</span>, vectors in the tangent space of the bundle. Then, we use the matrix exponential map for computing the Lie group values in <span>$SO(4)$</span>, which are points in the bundle. A point in the Lie group stemming from <code>q</code> is reconstructed by executing the statement <code>exp(θ * K(1) + -ϕ * K(2)) * q</code>, where scalars <code>θ</code> and <code>ϕ</code> denote the latitude and longitude components, respectively. <code>K(1)</code> and <code>K(2)</code> denote 4x4 matrices with real elements as a basis for <span>$so(4)$</span>, the Lie algebra. The tangent space of the bundle at point <code>q</code> is expanded horizontally with the exponential map of a linear combination of basis vectors <code>K(1)</code> and <code>K(2)</code>. This way we get a strictly horizontal section of the bundle in terms of the elemnts of the Lie group <span>$SO(4)$</span>.</p><p>Using the eigendecomposition method <code>eigen</code>, we can change the basis of the bundle while keeping the coordinates the same. So the change-of-basis is the final step of the construction of the observables after defining the chart and coordinatization. <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Observables.jl/tree/master"><code>Observables.jl</code></a> allows us to define the points that are to be rendered in the scene, in a way that they can listen to changes dynamically. Later, when we apply transformations to the bundle, including tha change-of-basis, the idea is to only change the top-level observables and avoid reconstructing the scene entirely. The change of basis is a bilinear transformation of the tetrad (of 𝕄) in ℝ⁴ as a matrix-vector product. Here we denote the transformation as the generic function <code>f</code>, which takes a <code>Quaternion</code> number as input and spits out a new number of the same type. The input and output bases must be orthonormal as the numbers must remain unit quaternions after the transformation. Constructing a base map requires a few arguments: the scene object, the base point of the section, the change-of-basis transformation, the chart, the number of segments of the lattice of observables, the tuxture of the surface and the optional transparency setting. With that, we construct four base maps in order to visualize a more complete picture of the Hopf fibration using four different sections. But, the sections are going to be distinguished from one another and updated with gauge transformations later when we animate the base maps.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">basemap1 = Basemap(lscene, q, x -&gt; x, chart, segments, mask, transparency = true)

The lift is specified by two real values and is realized by executing the statement <code>exp(K(3) * θ) * p</code>, where scalar <code>θ</code> denotes the fiber action value, and <code>K(3)</code> denotes the vertical direction of the tangent space at point <code>p</code> of the bundle. By varying <code>θ</code> in a linear space of floating point values, a <code>Whirl</code> takes a three-dimensional volume. In the special case where <code>θ</code> is a range of values, starting at zero and stopping at 2π, the Whirl makes a Hopf band. The bondary in Geographic cordinates is lifted via a section <code>σmap</code> to make the points denoted by <code>p</code>. Then, multiplying <code>p</code> on the left by the exponentiation of <code>K(3) * θ</code> pushes <code>p</code> up along the vertical subspace of the bundle.</p><p>There are four sets of whirls: some whirls are more solid and some whirls are more transparent. This separation is done to highlight the antipodal points of the three-dimensional sphere <span>$S^3$</span>, given by <span>$x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 = 1$</span>, where <span>$[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4]^T \in \R^4$</span>. It also helps to visualize the direction of the null plane under transformations of the bundle. Since every pair of points that are infinitestimally close to each other in a horizontal cross-section, defines a differential operator. And fiber actions, transformations from the bundle into itself change the direction of the operator. The operator is also called a spin-vector in Minkowski vector space 𝕍. Therefore it can be visualized directly how the operator changes sign by comparing a closed boundary at antipodal points.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">whirls1 = []

The generic function <code>getcolor</code> finds the correct color to set for the <code>Whirl</code>. It takes as input a closed boundary (a vector of Cartesian points), a color reference image and an alpha channel value to produce an <code>RGBA</code> color. <code>getcolor</code> finds a color according to the following steps: First, it determine the number of points in the given boundary. Second, gets the size of the reference color image as height and width in pixels. Third, converts all of the boundary points to Geograpic coordinates. Fourth, finds the minimum and maximum values of the latitudes and longitudes of the boundary. Fifth, creates a two-dimensional linear space (a flat grid or lattice) that ranges within the upper and lower bounds of the latitudes and longitudes. Sixth, finds the Cartesian two-dimensional coordinates of the points in the image space by normalizing the geographic coordinates and multiplying them by the image size. Seventh, picks the color of each grid point with the Cartesian two-dimensional coordinates in the image space as the index. Eighth, Makes a histogram of the colors by counting the number of each color. Finally, sorts the histogram and picks the color with the greatest number of occurance.</p><p>However, step seven makes sure that the coordinates in the linear 2-space are inside the closed boundary, otherwise it skips the index and continues with the next index in the grid. In this way we don&#39;t pick colors from the boundaries of neighboring countries over the globe. The generic function <code>isinside</code> is used by <code>getcolor</code> to determine whether the given point is inside the given boundary or not. But first, the boundary needs to become a polygon in the Euclidean 2-space of coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. This is the same as geographic coordinates with the radius of Earth set equal to 1 identically, hence the spherical Earth model of the ancient Greeks. After we make a polygon out of the boundary, the generic function <code>rayintersectseg</code> determines whther a ray cast from a point of the linear grid intersects an edge with the given point <code>p</code> and <code>edge</code>. Here, <code>p</code> is a two-dimensional point and <code>edge</code> is a tuple of such points, representing a line segment. Eventhough this algorithm should work in theory, some boundaries are too small to yield a definite color via <code>getcolor</code> and the color inference algorithm returns a false negative in those cases. So the default color may be white for a limited number of cases out of 248 countries. Once we have the color of the whirls, we can proceed to construct the whirls by supplying the generic function <code>Whirl</code> with the following arguments: the scene object, the boundary points lifetd via an arbitrary section, the first fiber action value (gauge), the second action value, the change-of-basis function <code>f</code>, the number of surface segments, the color and the optional transparency setting.</p><h2 id="Animate-a-Four-Screw"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Animate-a-Four-Screw">Animate a Four-Screw</a><a id="Animate-a-Four-Screw-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Animate-a-Four-Screw" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>A four-screw is a kind of restricted Lorentz transformation where a z-boost and a proper rotation of the celestial sphere are applied. The transformation lives in a four-complex dimensional space and it has six degrees of freedom. By parameterizing a four-screw one can control how much boost and rotation a transformation shuld have. Here, <code>w</code> as a positive scalar controls the amount of boost, whereas angle <code>ψ</code> controls the rotation component of the transform. But, the parameterization accepts <em>rapidity</em> as input for the boost. So we take the natural logarithm of <code>w</code> (<span>$log(w) = \phi$</span>) in order to supply the transformer with the required rapidity argument. First, we set <code>w</code> equal to one in order to preserve the scale of the Argand plane and animate the angle <code>ψ</code> through zero to 2π for rotation.

The <em>length</em> or <em>norm</em> of an abstract vector <span>$u \in V$</span> is equivalent to the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself: <span>$&lt;u, u&gt; \equiv \sqrt{&lt;u, u&gt;} \in \R$</span>. The inner product of vectors <span>$u$</span> and <span>$v$</span> in an abstract vector space is given by <span>$u^T * g_{\mu\nu} * v$</span>, where <span>$g_{\mu\nu}$</span> denotes the metric 2-tensor. However, as an instantiation in Minkowski vector space 𝕍 with signature (+, -, -, -), the matrix <span>$g_{\mu\nu}$</span> is a diagonal of the form: <span>$g_{\mu\nu} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}$</span>.</p><p>Furthermore, a vector in 𝕍 is in the tangent space at some point in Einstein&#39;s spacetime, where the metric <span>$g_{\mu\nu}$</span> will not be diagonal anymore. Since a Lorentz transformation of null vectors has the same effect on vectors that are not null, it makes the visualization easier to study transformations on null vectors only. On the other hand, in the Euclidean 4-space <span>$E^4$</span> the metric <span>$g_{\mu\nu}$</span> is the identity matrix of dimension four. A null vector in the Minkowski vector space has length zero in terms of the Lorentz norm, but has Euclidean norm equal to one, and so it can be regarded as a unit <code>Quaternion</code>. Therefore, what we are animating here is the transformation of unit quaternions that represent null vectors. </p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">X, Y, Z = vec(ℝ³(0.0, 1.0, 0.0))

By constructing a four-complex-dimensional vector off of the eigenvalues we can normalize <code>M</code> by normalizing the vector of eigenvalues, before reconstructing a unimodular, unitary transformation (a normal matrix).

Because <code>ζ</code> is a union of complex numbers and the singleton of infinity (of type <code>Union{Complex, ComplexF64, Float64}</code>). For an inhomogeneous coordinate system we treat the point at infinity in a different way. For example, for all values of <code>w</code>, if <code>ζ</code> equals infinity then the rotation component of a four-screw should not have any effect on the north pole. But, multiplying positive infinity by a complex number of negative magnitude makes <code>ζ</code> equal to negative infinity, which is not in Argand plane. In that case, we first check the edge case to leave <code>ζ</code> unchanged whenever its value is infinity, <code>ζ = s.ζ</code>. No amount of z-boost and rotation should transform the north pole.

The correct dispatch is selected automatically for the job, based on the argument signature (whether the first argument is of type <code>Whirl</code> or <code>Basemap</code> for example). The selected method makes a 2-surface (lattice) of the horizontal section at base point <code>q</code> after transforming by <code>f</code>, with the given <code>segments</code> number and <code>chart</code>. A chart is a 4-tuple of real numbers that limits the expansion of the base point along horizontal directions in the horizontal subsapce of the Hopf bundle.</p><p>Second, the matrix of <code>ℝ³</code> along with the given basemap&#39;s observables are passed to the function <code>updatesurface!</code> for updating the observables. For each coordinate component x, y and z in the Euclidean 3-space <span>$E^3$</span>, there is a corresponding matrix of real numbers, of the same size: (<code>segments</code> by <code>segments</code>). In the type structure of a <code>Basemap</code> or a <code>Whirl</code> there is a tuple whose elements are of type <code>Observable</code>. Each element of the three-tuple in turn contains a matrix of components x, y or z. Reshaping a matrix of 3-vectors into three matrices of scalars is done because when we instantiated a <code>GLMakie</code> surface in the beginning, we supplied it with three observables representing x, y and z coordinates separately. The generic function <code>buildsurface</code> from the source file <em>surface.jl</em> builds a surface with the given <code>scene</code>, <code>value</code>, <code>color</code> and <code>transparency</code>. Here, the <code>value</code> argument is of type <code>Matrix{ℝ³}</code>.

The coordinate component <code>ϕ</code> is divided by a factor of four since in geographic coordinates longitudes range from -π to +π, whereas latitudes range from -π / 2 to +π / 2. This division rescales the longitude component of coordinates and allows us to have a square bundle chart, compared to coordinate components <code>θ</code>.

The function <code>update_cam!</code> takes the scene object along with the three required vectors as arguments and updates the camera. But, our camera position and orientation vectors are of type ℝ³, and not <code>Vec3f</code>. To match the argument type we need to use the generic function <code>vec</code> and the <code>splat</code> operator in order to instantiate objects of type <code>Vec3f</code>, because <code>update_cam!</code> is going to match the given type with its own signature.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">GLMakie.update_cam!(lscene.scene, GLMakie.Vec3f(vec(eyeposition)...), GLMakie.Vec3f(vec(lookat)...), GLMakie.Vec3f(vec(up)...))</code></pre><h2 id="Record-an-Animation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Record-an-Animation">Record an Animation</a><a id="Record-an-Animation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Record-an-Animation" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>The function <code>write</code> takes as input an integer called <code>frame</code> and updates the scene observables according to the stages that we described earlier. First, it calculates the progress of the animation frames, dividing <code>frame</code> by <code>frames_number</code>. For different properties of Lorentz transformations we have four stages, each stage having its own progress. The signature of the four-screw animator function is <code>animate_fourscrew(progress::Float64, status::Int)</code>. For example, stage one animates a pure boost by calling the function <code>animate_fourscrew</code> with <code>status</code> equal to 1. Stage 2 animates a proper rotation. Then, stage 3 animates a four-screw. Finally, stage 4 animates a null rotation by calling the function <code>animate_nullrotation</code>. After calling each stage function, we update the camera by calling the function <code>updatecamera</code>.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">write(frame::Int) = begin

Next, we created and animated observables in the scene, on a frame by frame basis. Now, we record the scene by passing the figure <code>fig</code>, the file path of the resulting video, and the range of frame numbers to the <code>record</code> function. The frame is incremented by <code>record</code> and the frame number is passed to the function <code>write</code> to animate the observables. Once the frame number reaches the total number of animation frames, recording is finished and a video file is saved on the hard drive at the file path: <em>gallery/planethopf.mp4</em>.</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">GLMakie.record(fig, joinpath(&quot;gallery&quot;, &quot;$modelname.mp4&quot;), 1:frames_number) do frame
