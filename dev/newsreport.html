For the Symmetries relevant in field theories, the groups act on fields and leave the Lagrangian or the action (the spacetime integral over the Lagrangian) invariant. In theoretical physics, Lie groups like the Lorentz and Poincaré groups, which are related to spacetime symmetries, and gauge groups, defining <em>internal</em> symmetries, are important cornerstones. Lie algebras are also important in gauge theories: <em>connections on principal bundles</em>, also known as <em>gauge boson fields</em>, are (locally) 1-forms on spacetime with values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group. The Lie algebra <span>$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$</span> plays a special role in physics, because as a real Lie algebra it is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the <em>Lorentz group</em> of 4-dimensional spacetime. At least locally, fields in physics can be described by maps on spacetime with values in vector spaces.</p><p>The adjoint representation is also important in physics, because <em>gauge bosons</em> correspond to fields on spacetime that transform under the adjoint representation of the gauge group. As we will discuss in Sect. 6.8.2 in more detail, the group <span>$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$</span> is the (<em>orthochronous</em>) <em>Lorentz spin group</em>, i.e. the universal covering of the identity component of the Lorentz group of 4-dimensional spacetime. The fundamental geometric opbject in a gauge theory is a principal bundle over spacetime with <em>structure group</em> given by the gauge group. The fibers of a principal bundle are sometimes thought of as an internal space at every spacetime point, not belonging to spacetime itself. Fiber bundles are indispensible in gauge theory and physics in the situation where spacetime, the <em>base manifold</em>, has a non-trivial topology.</p><p>It also happens if we compactify (Euclidean) spacetime <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span> to the 4-sphere <span>$S^4$</span>. In these situations, fields on spacetime often cannot be described simply by a map to a fixed vector space, but rather as <em>sections</em> of a non-trivial vector bundle. We will see that this is similar to the difference in special relativity between Minkowski spacetime and the choice of an inertial system. This can be compared, in special relativity, to the choice of an inertial system for Minkowski spacetime <span>$M$</span>, which defines an identification on <span>$M \cong \mathbb{R}^4$</span>. Of course, different choices of gauges are possible, leading to different trivializations of the principal bundle, just as different choices of inertial systems lead to different identifications of spacetime with <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span>.</p><p>Note that, if we consider principal bundles over Minkowski spacetime <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span>, it does not matter for this discussion that principal bundles over Euclidean spaces are always trivial by Corollary 4.2.9. This is very similar to special relativity, where spacetime is trivial, i.e. isomorphic to <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span> with a Minkowski metric, but what matters is the independence of the actual trivialization, i.e. the choice of inertial system.

In particular, we can describe matter fields on a spacetime diffeomorphic to <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span> by unique maps from <span>$\mathbb{R}^4$</span> into a vector space, <em>once a global gauge for the principal bundle has been chosen</em>. At least locally (after a choice of local gauge) we can interpret connection 1-forms as fields on spacetime (the base manifold) with values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group. Notice that connections are <strong>not unique</strong> (if <span>$dim M, dim G \ge 1$</span>), not even in the case of trivial principal bundles (all connections that appear in the Standard Model over Minkowski spacetime, for example, are defined on trivial principal bundles). The diffeomorphism group <span>$Diff(M)$</span> of spacetime <span>$M$</span> plays a comparable role in general relativity.</p><p>This is related to the fact that gauge theories describe local interactions (the interactions occur in single spacetime points). The local connection 1-form is thus defined on an open subset in the base manifold <span>$M$</span> and can be considered as a &quot;field on spacetime&quot; in the usual sense. Generalized Electric and Magnetic Fields on Minkowski Spacetime of Dimension 4 In quantum field theory, the gauge field <span>$A_{\mu}$</span> is a function on spacetime with values in the operators on the Hilbert state space <span>$V$</span> (if we ignore for the moment questions of whether this operator is well-defined and issues of regularization). By Corollary 5.13.5 this difference can be identified with a 1-form on spacetime <span>$M$</span> with values in <span>$Ad(P)$</span>.</p><p>In physics this fact is expressed by saying that gauge bosons, the differences <span>$A_{\mu}-A_{\mu}^0$</span>, are fields on spacetime that transform in the adjoint representation of <span>$G$</span> under gauge transformations. In the case of Minkowski spacetime, rotations correspond to Lorentz transformations. The pseudo-Riemannian case, like the case of Minkowski spacetime, is discussed less often, even though it is very important for physics (a notable exception is the thorough discussion in Helga Baun&#39;s book [13]). <span>$\mathbb{R}^{s,1}$</span> and <span>$\mathbb{R}^{1,t}$</span> are the two versions of <em>Minkowski spacetime</em> (both versions are used in physics). This includes the particular case of the Lorentz group of Minkowski spacetime.</p><p>However, as mentioned above, depending on the convention, 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in quantum field theory can have signature <span>$(+,-,-,-)$</span>, so that time carries the plus sign. Example 6.1.20 For applications concerning the Standard Model, the most important of these groups is the proper orthochronous Lorentz group <span>$SO^+(1,3) \cong SO^+(3,1)$</span> of 4-dimensional Minkoeski spacetime. They are physical gamma matrices for <span>$Cl(1,3)$</span>, i.e. for the Clifford algebra of Minkowski spacetime with signature <span>$(+,-,-,-)$</span>, in the so-called <em>Weyl representation</em> or <em>chiral representation</em>. Example 6.3.18 Let <span>$\Gamma_a$</span> and <span>$\gamma_a = i \Gamma_a$</span> be the physical and mathematical gamma matrices for <span>$Cl(1,3)$</span> considered in Example 6.3.17. If we set <span>$\Gamma_a^\prime = \gamma_a$</span>, <span>$\gamma_a^\prime = i \Gamma_a^\prime = -\Gamma_a$</span>, then these are physical and Mathematical gamma matrices for <span>$Cl(1,3)$</span> of Minkowski spacetime with signature <span>$(-,+,+,+)$</span>.

Interactions between fields corresponding to elementary particles (quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, Higgs bosons), determined by the Lagrangian. The Higgs mechanism of mass generation for gauge bosons as well as the mass generation for fermions via Yukawa couplings. The fact that there are 8 <em>gluons</em>, 3 <em>weak gauge bosons</em>, and 1 <em>photon</em> is related to the dimensions of the Lie groups <span>$SU(3)$</span> and <span>$SU(2) \times U(1)$</span>. Lie algebras are also important in gauge theories: <em>connections on principal bundles</em>, also known as <em>gauge boson fields</em>, are (locally) 1-forms on spacetime with values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group.</p><p>The adjoint representation is also important in physics, because <em>gauge bosons</em> correspond to fields on spacetime that transform under the adjoint representation of the gauge group. We also discuss special scalar products on Lie algebras which will be used in Sect. 7.3.1 to construct Lagrangians for gauge boson fields. The gauge bosons corresponding to these gauge groups are described by the <em>adjoint representation</em> that we discuss in Sect. 2.1.5. The representation <span>$Ad_H$</span> describes the representation of the gauge boson fields in the Standard Model. The fact that these scalar products are positive definite is important from a phenomenological point of view, because only then do the kinetic terms in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian have the right sign (the gauge bosons have positive kinetic energy [148]).</p><p><em>Connections</em> on principal bundles, that we discuss in Chap. 5, correspond to <em>gauge fields</em> whose particle excitations in the associated quantum field theory are the <em>gauge bosons</em> that transmit interactions. These fields are often called <em>gauge fields</em> and correspond in the associated quatum field theory to <em>gauge bosons</em>. This implies a direct interaction between gauge bosons (the gluons in QCD) that does not occur in abelian gauge theories like quantum electrodynamics (QED). The difficulties that are still present nowadays in trying to understand the quantum version of non-abelian gauge theories, like quantum chromodynamics, can ultimately be traced back to this interaction between gauge bosons. The real-valued fields <span>$A_\mu^a \in C^\infty(U,\mathbb{R})$</span> and the corresponding real-valued 1-forms <span>$A_s \in \Omega^1(U)$</span> are called <em>(local) gauge boson fields</em>.</p><p>In physics, the quadratic term <span>$[A_\mu, A_\nu]$</span> in the expression for <span>$F_{\mu\nu}$</span> (leading to cubic and quartic terms in the <em>Yang-Mills Lagrangian</em>, see Definition 7.3.1 and the corresponding local formula in Eq. (7.1)) is interpreted as a direct interaction between gauge bosons described by the gauge field <span>$A_\mu$</span>. This explains why gluons, the gauge bosons of QCD, interact directly with each other, while photons, the gauge bosons of QED, do not. This non-linearity, called <em>minimal coupling</em>, leads to non-quadratic terms in the Lagrangian (see Definition 7.5.5 and Definition 7.6.2 as well as the local formulas in Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4)), which are interpreted as an interaction between gauge bosons described by <span>$A_\mu$</span> and the particles described by the field <span>$\phi$</span>. We then get a better understanding of why gauge bosons in physics are said to transform under the adjoint representation.</p><p>Strictly speaking, gauge bosons, the excitations of the gauge field, should then be described classically by the difference <span>$A - A^0$</span>, where <span>$A$</span> is some other connection 1-form and not by the field <span>$A$</span> itself. In physics this fact is expressed by saying that gauge bosons, the differences <span>$A_\mu - A_\mu^0$</span>, are fields on spacetime that transform in the adjoint represntation of <span>$G$</span> under gauge transformations. Gauge fields correspond to gauge bosons (spin 1 particles) and are described by 1-forms or, dually, vector fields. Even though spinors are elementary objects, some of their properties (like the periodicity modulo 8, real and quaternionic structures, or bilinear and Hamiltonian scalar products) are not at all obvious, already on the level of linear algebra, and do not have a direct analogue in the bosonic world of vectors and tensors. The existence of <strong>gauge symmetries</strong> is particularly important: it can be shown that a quantum field theory involving massless spin 1 bosons can be consistent (i.e. unitary, see Sect. 7.1.3) only if it is gauge invariant [125,143].</p><h3 id="Graph"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Graph">Graph</a><a id="Graph-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Graph" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><img src="assets/newsreport/25.PNG" alt="25"/></p><p><strong>Edward Witten</strong> <em>(1987)</em>:</p><p>If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations:</p><ol><li><p>Spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold <span>$M$</span>, endowed with a metric tensor and governed by geometrical laws.</p></li><li><p>Over <span>$M$</span> is a Principal G-bundle <span>$X$</span> with a nonabelian gauge group <span>$G$</span>.</p></li><li><p>Fermions are sections of <span>$(\hat{S}_+ \otimes V_R) \oplus (\hat{S}_- \otimes V_{\tilde{R}})$</span>. <span>$R$</span> and <span>$\tilde{R}$</span> are not isomorphic; their failure to be isomorphic explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in a representation difference <span>$\Delta$</span> in some underlying theory.</p></li></ol><p>All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.</p><h2 id="What"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What">What</a><a id="What-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p><img src="assets/newsreport/26.PNG" alt="26"/></p><p>The Higgs mechanism of mass generation for gauge bosons as well as the mass generation for fermions via Yukawa couplings. Spin groups such as the universal covering of the Lorentz group and its higher dimesnional analogues, are also important in physics, because they are involved in the mathematical description of fermions. Counting in this way, the Standard Model thus contains at the most elementary level 90 fermions (particles and antiparticles). The complex vector space <span>$V$</span> of fermions, which carries a representation of <span>$G$</span>, has dimension 45 (plus the same number of corresponding antiparticles) and is the direct sum of the two G-invariant subspaces (sectors): a lepton sector of dimension 9 (where we do not include the hypothetical right-handed neutrinos) and a quark sector of dimension 36. Matter fields in the Standard Model, like quarks and leptons, or sacalar fields, like the Higgs field, correspond to sections of vector bundles <em>associated</em> to the principal bundle (and twisted by <em>spinor bundles</em> in the case of fermions).</p><p>For example, in the Standard Model, one generation of fermions is described by associated complex vector bundles of rank 8 for left-handed fermions and rank 7 for right-handed fermions, associated to representations of the gauge group <span>$SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$</span>. Matter fields in physics are described by smooth sections of vector bundles <span>$E$</span> associated to principal bundles <span>$P$</span> via the representations of the gauge group <span>$G$</span> on a vector space <span>$V$</span> (in the case of fermions the associated bundle <span>$E$</span> is twisted in addition with a <em>spinor bundle</em> <span>$S$</span>, i.e. the bundle is <span>$S \otimes E$</span>). Additional matter fields, like fermions or scalars, can be introduced using associated vector bundles. These particles are fermions (spin <span>$\frac{1}{2}$</span> particles) and are described by spinor fields (spinors). Dirac forms are used in the Standard Model to define a <strong>Dirac mass term</strong> in the Lagrangian for all fermions (except possibly neutrinos) and, together with the Dirac operator, the <strong>kinetic term</strong> and the <strong>interaction term</strong>; see Sect. 7.6. This is related to the fact that the weak interaction in the Standard Model is not invariant under parity inversion that exchanges left-handed with right-handed fermions.</p><h1 id="Perspective"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Perspective">Perspective</a><a id="Perspective-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Perspective" title="Permalink"></a></h1><h2 id="How"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#How">How</a><a id="How-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#How" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p><img src="assets/newsreport/27.PNG" alt="27"/></p><p><a href="https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig153bundle.jl">The particular case of a <em>trivial</em> bundle and the general case of a <em>twisted</em> bundle</a></p><p>There is a Cartesian product <span>$M \times V$</span>, above a local open region of the base manifold.

However, when matter is present, then a volume-reducing force field deforms spacetime too. From the inverse-square law of Newtonian physics we understand gravity as the volume-preservation of the Ricci component of the Riemann curvature tensor. The Riemann curvature tensor is a three-piece object, two of whose components are denoted by R_munu and R. Einstein’s spacetime discards the Weyl component of the curvature tensor and calculates the scalar curvature component R by taking the trace of the Ricci curvature component.</p><h4 id="How-do-they-relate?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#How-do-they-relate?">How do they relate?</a><a id="How-do-they-relate?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#How-do-they-relate?" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>The role of the Weyl curvature is not explained by Einstein’s field equation, even though cosmological observations suggest a role for it on a large scale. Einstein’s field equation combines the tidal effects of preserving the volume of spatial planes with respect to time, R<em>munu, and changes in matter density which turn out to be the curvature scalar R. What does this have to do with Penrose steps? When the Riemann curvature tensor in the presence of matter shows R</em>munu not equal to zero, the vector fields that flow along spatial and temporal directions deviate from their orthogonal geodesics. The Ricci curvature takes two vectors as input and outputs a scalar number. For an infinitesimal parallelogram at a spacetime event, the Ricci scalar is just the integral of a 1-form along the edges of the infinitesimal parallelogram. The exterior derivative of the 1-from becomes nonzero and so parallel transport stretches the path of a tangent vector with multiplication by either a scalar or a complex number. In a principal U(1)-bundle, a circular path in the base space forms a stack of circles in the total space as a result of the stretch with multiplication (in the presence of matter.) Therefore, the trajectory of a tangent vector along a circular path on the base space forms a spiral in the total space, which resembles the shape of Penrose steps or the Escher staircase.</p><h4 id="What-are-“horizontal-subspaces”-and-what-do-they-have-to-do-with-vector-potentials-and-gauge-fields?"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#What-are-“horizontal-subspaces”-and-what-do-they-have-to-do-with-vector-potentials-and-gauge-fields?">What are “horizontal subspaces” and what do they have to do with vector potentials and gauge fields?</a><a id="What-are-“horizontal-subspaces”-and-what-do-they-have-to-do-with-vector-potentials-and-gauge-fields?-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#What-are-“horizontal-subspaces”-and-what-do-they-have-to-do-with-vector-potentials-and-gauge-fields?" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>A connection (denoted by A) on a principal G-bundle P assigns a horizontal subspace of the tangent space to each point q in P, in a smooth way.

Second, the push forward of the horizontal subspace of the Principal G-bundle P at point q by an action g of the structure group G is equal to the horizontal subspace of the principal G-bundle P at the transformation of the point q by the action g, for all g in G and q in P. The Ricci curvature is 2-form with respect to a connection 1-form on spacetime. The 2-form that appears in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian is exact if and only if it is equal to the loop integral of a 1-form along the boundary of a very small oriented area (F_munu = dϕ). In other words, the loop integral of the 1-form ϕ, along the boundary of a region (a parallelogram) equals the integral of the exterior derivative of the 1-form over the region. But if this 1-form exists (an exact symmetry,) then the integral introduces a gauge potential, where one has the freedom to change the constant as a reference level, also known as a gauge transformation.</p><h3 id="Tome"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Tome">Tome</a><a id="Tome-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Tome" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p><img src="assets/newsreport/43.PNG" alt="43"/></p><h1 id="Wrap-Up"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Wrap-Up">Wrap Up</a><a id="Wrap-Up-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Wrap-Up" title="Permalink"></a></h1><h2 id="Why"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Why">Why</a><a id="Why-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Why" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p><img src="assets/newsreport/44.PNG" alt="44"/></p><p><img src="assets/newsreport/45.PNG" alt="45"/></p><p><a href="https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig201configurationspace.jl">Configuration space</a></p><p>Each point in the configuration space represents a possible configuration of the chassis, reaction wheel and rolling wheel.

Multiplication on both the left and right sides of a Quaternion number with another Quaternion preserves the round metric on S³. There are three different flows on the surface of the 3-sphere. The first flow is in the direction of the vector field K₁, the second flow follows along vector field K₂, and finally the third flow moves in the direction of K₃ ∈ so(4). Each element of the vector fields K₁, K₂ and K₃ is a 4x4 matrix of real elements ℝ, as a basis for the special orthogonal group so(4), the Lie algebra of the group of rotations of ℝ⁴ and motions in S³. Since lengths and angles are preserved along the flows, the Quaternionic motion pushes elements around in a 3-sphere. Yet, so(4) is a 6-dimensional symmetry group because multiplication is not commutative for a pair of Quaternions. Another way to think about it is: four choose two equals six, where we count the number of basis 2-forms in four dimensions. As a consequence, there is a linear transformation that preserves a scalar product, mapping from 2 copies of S³ to the Special Orthogonal group of real dimension 4, SO(4). However, the multiplication of the identity matrix with itself results in no motion at all, so does the multiplication of minus identity with itself. Therefore, if we denote the 4 by 4 identity matrix with ‘I’, then the tuple of inputs (I, I) and (-I, -I) are in the kernel of the map: S³ × S³ \ {(I, I), (-I, -I)} → SO(4).</p><p>An Ehresmann connection distributes the tangent bundle of S³ into two orthogonal subspaces. Vectors tangent to S³ make a right angle with a radial line. A connection 1-form ϕ on the Clifford bundle eats a vector tangent to S³ as input, and together with the infinitesimal motion along K₃, uses a scalar product to spit out a scalar number as output. On the other hand, vectors ϵu and ϵv show infinitesimal motions in the direction of K₁ and K₂, respectively. Then, the exterior derivative of the 1-form is calculated as Ω = (ϕb<em>v - ϕd</em>v) - (ϕc<em>u - ϕa</em>u), where ϕa_u denotes the value of the 1-form ϕ at point ‘a’ in the direction of ϵu. So, the exterior derivative of a 1-form ϕ is a 2-form Ω. We assume that all three flows (K₁, K₂ and K₃) are closed, meaning the exterior derivative of each one of the flows equals zero. Counting the number of equally-spaced sections pierced by K₃, one finds that the flow has non-zero period (circulation). Now, for a general vector field on S³ where a linear combination of vector fields K₁, K₂ and K₃ represents a flow, the period is no longer a scalar and is calculated as a 3-vector of the contribution of each one of the three flows. This implies that the first de Rahm cohomology group of S³ is equal to ℝ³.</p><p>After continuous deformations of a parallelepiped at point ‘p’, one can think of the volume form of three tangent vectors in K₁, K₂ and K₃ as a blister, enclosing a 3-region. The exterior derivative of a closed 2-form (dΩ) is equal to zero. Deformation theorem for closed 2-forms states that the period of a closed 2-form out of a closed 2-surface is invariant under a continuous deformation of the surface. Because the 2-form is closed dΩ = 0, what flows into the blister must flow out. So the flux out of the volume is invariant under deformations. Furthermore, Hamilton’s principle for field Lagrangians means that a field configuration follows a geodesic in the configuration space, whose tangent bundle is where the Lagrangian is defined. The case that we illustrate here, configures the 2-form with two vectors ϵu and ϵv in the horizontal subspace at ‘p’, where the loop integral of ϕ along the boundary of a parallelogram (with midpoints a, b, c and d) is stationary. In spacetime however, the Yang-Mills Lagrangian scales a 4-form at each point, such that the integral of the scaled differential form is stationary over a 4-region, which is enclosed between two fixed 3-regions. The boundary of the pair of 3-regions can come together in an asymptotic way, or they can be glued together. For example, in the case of gluing two copies of a sphere together, we use the clutching construction to build the tangent bundle, which in turn gives rise to spinors that define the Dirac Lagrangian.</p><p><img src="assets/newsreport/54.PNG" alt="54"/></p><p><a href="https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig2010fieldlagrangians.jl">Hamilton&#39;s principle for field Lagrangians</a></p><p>The boundary of a well-behaved compact oriented 4-dimensional region is a 3-dimensional region. The boundary consists of those points of the 4-region that do not lie in the interior. Hamilton’s principle states that the integral of a 4-form, scaled by some field Lagrangian, over a 4-dimensional region is stationary.</p><p>The following three chapters discuss applications in physics: the Lagrangians and interactions in the Standard Model, spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs mechanism of mass generation, and some more advanced and modern topics like neutrino masses and CP violation. Depending on the time, the interests and the prior knowledge of the reader, he or she can take a shortcut and immediately start at the chapters on connections, spinors or Lagrangians, and then go back if more detailed mathematical knowledge is required at some point. An interesting and perhaps underappreciated fact is that a substantial number of phenomena in particle physics can be understood by analysing representations of Lie groups and by rewriting or rearranging Lagrangians.</p><p>Symmetries of Lagrangians interactions between fields corresponding to elementary particles (quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, Higgs boson), determined by the Lagrangian. For the symmetries relevant in field theories, the groups act on fields and leave the <em>Lagrangian</em> or the <em>action</em> (the spacetime integral over the Lagrangian) invariant. In the following chapter we will study some associated concepts, like representations (which are used to define the actions of Lie groups on fields) and invariant matrices (which are important in the construction of the gauge invariant Yang-Mills Lagrangian). We also discuss special scalar products on Lie algebras which will be used in Sect. 7.3.1 to construct Lagrangians for gauge boson fields.</p><p>The existence of positive definite Ad-invariant scalar products on the Lie algebra of compact Lie groups is very important in gauge theory, in particular, for the construction of the gauge-invariant <em>Yang-Mills Lagrangian</em>; see Sect. 7.3.1. The fact that these scalar products are positive definite is important from a phenomenological point of view, because only then do the kinetic terms in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian have the right sign (the gauge bosons have positive kinetic energy [148]). In a gauge-invariant Lagrangian this results in terms of order higher than two in the matter and gauge fields, which are interpreted as interactions between the corresponding particles. In non-abelian gauge theories, like quantum chromodynamics (QCD), there are also terms in the Lagrangian of order higher than two in the gauge fields themselves, coming from a quadratic term in the curvature that appears in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian.</p><p>In physics, the quadratic term <span>$[A_\mu, A_\nu]$</span> in the expression for <span>$F_{\mu\nu}$</span> (leading to cubic and quartic terms in the <em>Yang-Mills Lagrangian</em>, see Definition 7.3.1 and the corresponding local formula in Eq. (7.1)) is interpreted as a direct interaction between gauge bosons described by the gauge field <span>$A_\mu$</span>. These covariant derivatives appear in physics, in particular, in the Lagrangians and field equations defining gauge theories. This non-linearity, called <em>minimal coupling</em>, leads to non-quadratic terms in the Lagrangian (see Definition 7.5.5 and Definition 7.6.2 as well as the local formulas in Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4)), which are interpreted as an interaction between gauge bosons described by <span>$A_\mu$</span> and the particles described by the field <span>$\phi$</span>.</p><p>Figure 5.2 shows the Feynman diagrams for the cubic and quartic terms which appear in the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian in Eq.
