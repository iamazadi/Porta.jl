[{"location":"hopffibration.html#The-Hopf-Fibration","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"The Hopf Fibration","text":"The Hopf fibration is a fiber bundle with a two-dimensional sphere as the base space and circles as the fiber space. It is the geometrical shape that relates Einstein's spacetime to quantum fields. In this model, we visualize the Hopf fibration by first computing its points via a bundle atlas and then rendering the points in 3D space via stereographic projection. The projection step is necessary because the Hopf fibration is embedded in a four-space. Yet, it has only three degrees of freedom as a three-dimensional shape. The idea that makes this model more special and interesting than a typical visualization is the idea of Planet Hopf, due to Dror Bar-Natan (2010). The basic idea is that since the Hopf map takes the three-dimensional sphere into the two-dimensional sphere, we can pull the skin of the globe back to the three-sphere and visualize it.\n\nInto the bargain, the Earth rotates about its axis every 24 hours. That spinning transformation of the Earth, together with the non-trivial product space of the Hopf bundle, can be encoded naturally into a monolithic visualization. It also makes sense to visualize differential operators in the Minkowski space-time as vectors in a cross-section of the Hopf bundle and then study the properties of spin-transformations. The choice of a gauge transformation (or trivialization) along with Lorentz transformations of Minkowski spacetime should not have any effect on physical laws. It is therefore a great model to understand these transformations and walk the road to reality. The following explains how the source code for generating animations of the Hopf fibration works (alternative views of Planet Hopf). We follow the beginning of chapter 4 of Mark J.D. Hamilton (2018) for a formal definition of the Hopf fibration as a fiber bundle. The book Mathematical Gauge Theory explains the Standard Model to students of both mathematics and physics, covers both the specific gauge theory of the Standard Model and generalizations, and is highly accessible and self-contained. Then, the definitions are going to be used to explain the source code in terms of computational methods and types.\n\n(Image: image1) (Image: board2) (Image: image2)\n\nFirst, let E and M be smooth manifolds. Then, pi E to M is a surjective and differentiable map between smooth manifolds. Meaning, every element in M has some corresponding element in E via the map pi. Now, let x in M be a point. A fiber of pi over point x is called E_x and defined as a non-empty subset of E as follows: E_x = pi^-1(x) = pi^-1(x) subset E. The singleton of x is taken to the manifold E by the inverse of the map pi. However, to have a set of more than one point let U be a subset of M, U subset M. Then, we have E_U = pi^-1(U) subset E. In this case, E_U is the part of E above the subset U.\n\n(Image: image3) (Image: board3) (Image: image4)\n\nNext, define a global section of the map pi like this: s M to E. Considering the definition of pi E to M, the definition of the global section implies that the composition of pi and s is the identity map pi  o  s = Id_M over M. A section such as s can be a local one if we take a subset of M in the domain, U subset M. Then, a local section is defined as s U to E. In a similar way the definition of the local section implies that its composition with pi is the idenity map over the subset: pi  o  s = Id_U. For all points x in subset U, the section s(x) is in the fiber E_x of pi above x, if and only if s is a local section of pi. In this pointwise case, the map pi is restricted to subset U. In other words pi E to U, where U subset M.\n\n(Image: image5) (Image: board4) (Image: image6)\n\nIn general, for two points x not = y in M that are not equal, the fibers E_x and E_y of pi over x and y may not be embedded submanifolds of E, or even be diffeomorphic. That means, there may not be a differentiable and invertible map that takes fiber E_x into fiber E_y, and the tangent spaces of E_x and E_y over points x and y may not be naturally linear subspaces of the tangent space of E. But, it is different in the special instance where manifold E = M times F is the product of M and the general fiber F and pi as a map is the projection onto the first factor pi M times F to M. If that is the case, then fibers E_x E_y in F of pi over the two distinct points x not = y in M are embedded submanifolds of E and diffeomorphic. To explain it more clearly, given that condition, there exists an invertible and smooth map taking one fiber to the other, and the tangent spaces of the fibers are directly summed with their respective dual subspaces at points in the fibers to span the whole tangent space of manifold E at points of pi over x and y. Therefore, fiber bundles are the generalization of products E = M times F as twisted products.\n\n(Image: image7) (Image: board5) (Image: image8)\n\nBefore we define the Hopf action, first describe a scalar multiplication rule between vectors and numbers. Let R denote real numbers, Complex complex numbers, and mathbbH quaternionic numbers. On top of that, take a subset of these sets of numbers such that zero is not allowed to be in them, and denote the subsets as R^*, Complex^*, and mathbbH^* respectively. Now, define the linear right action by scalar multiplication for mathbbK = mathbbR mathbbC mathbbH as the following: mathbbK^n+1setminus0 times mathbbK^* to mathbbK^n+1setminus0. For example, 5 in mathbbR^* is a non-zero scalar number, whereas 1 0 0^T in mathbbR^3setminus0 is a non-zero vector quantity. Per our definition, 5 acts on 1 0 0^T on the right and yields 5 0 0 in mathbbR^3setminus0 as another vector. This rule works the same for fields mathbbK even when the vectorial numbers are represented by matrices.\n\n(Image: image9) (Image: board6) (Image: image10)\n\nThe linear right action by multiplication is called a free action, because for x in mathbbK^n+1setminus0 and y in mathbbk^* the multiplication x times y yields x if and only if y = Id, as the identity element. For example, if we let x = 0 1 0^T y = 1, then the result of the scalar multiplication is 0 1 0^T times 1 = 0 1 0^T.\n\n(Image: image11) (Image: board7) (Image: image12)\n\nIn addition, we define the unit n-sphere, for the Hopf action works on spheres. So, the unit sphere of dimension n is defined as: S^n(w_1 w_2  w_n+1) in mathbbR^n+1  sum_substack1 leq i leq n+1w_i^2 = 1. As an example, the unit circle S^1 in mathbbC is a one-dimensional sphere with n = 1, and w_1^2 + w_2^2 = 1, where w_1 and w_2 are the horizontal and vertical axes in the complex plane, respectively.\n\n(Image: image13) (Image: board8) (Image: image14)\n\nNow, Hopf actions are defined as free actions:\n\nS^n times S^0 to S^n \nS^2n+1 times S^1 to S^2n+1 \nS^4n+3 times S^3 to S^4n+3 \n\ngiven by (x lambda) mapsto xlambda.\n\n(Image: image15) (Image: board9) (Image: image16)\n\nAn example of a Hopf action is the multiplication of the three-sphere S^3 cong SU(2) subset mathbbC^2 on the right by the unit circle S^1 cong U(1) subset mathbbC. Define the Hopf action as the map Phi S^3 times S^1 to S^3 given by (v w lambda) mapsto (v w) sdot lambda = (vlambda wlambda), for all points in the unit 3-sphere (v w) in S^3 and the unit 1-sphere lambda in S^1. What's more, the Hopf action has two properties:\n\n(v w) sdot (lambda sdot mu) = ((v w) sdot lambda) sdot mu\n(v w) sdot 1 = (v w)\n\nforall (v w) in S^3  lambda mu in S^1.\n\n(Image: image17) (Image: board10) (Image: image18)\n\nThe next idea is about the orbit of a point in the 3-sphere S^3 under the Hopf action. The orbit map is defined as phi S^1 to S^3 given by lambda mapsto (v_0 w_0) sdot lambda, forall (v_0 w_0) in S^3. The orbit map phi is injective and free, meaning that a point in S^3 can not have many points in S^1 and also there exists an identity element such that the action stabalizes a point in S^3 such as (v_0 w_0). Furthermore, the Hopf action Phi S^1 to Diff(S^3) is a homomorphism. It preserves S^3. The Hopf action being a free action implies that the orbit of every point (v_0 w_0) in S^3 is an embedded circle S^1.\n\n(Image: image19) (Image: board11) (Image: image20)\n\nBack to the topic of fiber bundles, we recall that the part of manifold E over subset U equals: E_U = pi^-1(U) subset E, where U subset M. Here, there is an equivalence relation in the fiber E_x of pi over x, since the orbit of a point in fiber E_x by phi collapses onto a single point x in U via the projection map pi S^3 to S^3texttextasciitilde. After the collapse of every fiber in manifold E, the quotient space S^3S^1 is seen to be the projective complex line mathbbCP^1 cong S^2. The projective complex line is the ratio of two complex numbers. To see how the space of S^3 is connected compared to S^1, note that every closed loop in S^3 is shrinkable to a single point in a continuous way, tracing a local section. However, a closed loop in S^1 is not shrinkable to a single point. This fact makes S^3 a simply-connected space and S^1 a not simply-connected space.\n\n(Image: image21) (Image: board12) (Image: image22)\n\nWe are now almost equipped with the tools to define a fiber bundle in a formal way. Let E F M be manifolds. The projection map pi E to M is a surjective and differentiable map (Every element in M has some element in E). Then, (E pi M F) is called a fiber bundle, (or a locally trivial fibration, or a locally trivial bundle) if for every x in M there exists an open neighborhood U subset M around the point x such that the map pi restricted to E_U can be trivialized as a cross product. Remember that E_U is the part of E of pi over U. In other words, (E pi M F) is called a fiber bundle if there exists a diffeomorphism phi_U E_U to U times F such that pr_1  o  phi_U = pi, meaning the projection onto the first factor of the trivialization map phi_U is the same as the map pi. Also, a fiber bundle is denoted by F to E xrightarrowpi M. In this notation, E denotes the total space, M the base manifold, F the general fiber, pi the projection, and (U phi_U) a local trivialization or bundle chart.\n\n(Image: image23) (Image: board13) (Image: image24)\n\nUsing a local trivialization (U phi_U) E_x = pi^-1(x) we find that the fiber E_x is an embedded submanifold of the total space E for every point x in M. Meaning, the tangent space of fiber E_x is a linear subsapce of the tangent space of E. The direct sum of the tangent subspace of the general fiber and the tangent subspace of the base manifold equals the tangent space of the total space: T_xE = V_xE bigoplus H_xE.\n\n(Image: image25) (Image: board14) (Image: image26)\n\nThe composition of the local trivialization with the projection onto the second factor gives us yet another useful map between fibers E_x over x and the general fiber F. It is a differentiable and invertible map (diffeomorphism) and equals phi_U = pr_2  o  phi_U _E_x E_x to F. Given that the local trivialization phi_U E_U to U times F is a diffeomorphism (invertible and smooth), the projection pr_1 U times F to U onto the first factor of phi_U is a submersion. That is to say the differntial of pr_1 is surjective. D pr_1 T(U times F) to TU takes vectors from the tangent space of U times F into vectors in the tangent space of U, such that every element of TU has some element in T(U times F). As a result, the map pi E to M is also a submersion, which means D pi TE to TM is surjective. Every tangent vector in the codomain TM has some tangent vector in the domain TE.\n\n(Image: image27) (Image: board15) (Image: image28)\n\nSo far, we have established that the bundle projection map, taking points from the total space into points in the base space pi E to M, is a submersion. For that reason, the tangent space of the base manifold M is a linear subset of the tangnet space of the total space manifold E. Now, we can use the regular value theorem for shining a light on the submersion of pi. Let a point x in M be a regular value of the smooth map pi E to M, and let the fiber E_x = pi^-1(x) be the preimage of the point x. Then, the map pi^-1 is an embedded submanifold of E of dimension dim  E_x = dim  E - dim  M. Meaning, the tangent space of fiber E_x is a linear subspace of the tangent space of E. We can verify the result of the theorem for the Hopf bundle F to E xrightarrowpi M where dim  E = 3 and dim  M = 2. The regular value theorem implies that the Hopf fiber is one-dimensional, dim  E_x = 3 - 2 = 1, as an embedded submanifold of the total space E. With that formal introduction we are going to sketch a visual 3D model next.\n\n(Image: image29) (Image: board16) (Image: image30) (Image: image31)","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Import-the-Required-Packages","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Import the Required Packages","text":"Begin by importing a few software packages for doing algebraic operations, working with files and graphics processing units. Besides Porta, we need to use three packages: FileIO, GLMakie and LinearAlgebra. First, FileIO is the main package for IO and loading all different kind of files, including images and Comma-Separated Value (CSV) files. Second, interactive data visualizations and plotting in Julia are done with GLMakie. Finally, LinearAlgebra, as a module of the Julia programming language, provides array arithmetic, matrix factorizations and other linear algebra related functionality. However, through years of working with geometrical structures and shapes we have encapsulated certain mathematical computations and transformations into custom types and interfaces, which make up most of the functionalities of project Porta. In addition, we wrapped complicated computer graphics workflows inside custom types in order to increase the interoperability of our types with those of external packages such as GLMakie.\n\n    import FileIO\n    import GLMakie\n    import LinearAlgebra\n    using Porta","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Set-Hyperparameters","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Set Hyperparameters","text":"There are essential hyperparameters that determine the complexity of graphics rendering as well as the position and orientation of a camera, through which we render a scene. Since the output of the model is an animation video, we need to set the figure size to 1920 by 1080 to have a full high definition window, in which the scene is located. Most of the shapes and objects that we put inside of the scene are two-dimensional surfaces. Therefore, the segmentation of most shapes requires two integer values for determining how much compute power and resolution we are willing to spend on the animation. Furthermore, the shape of a circle is the most common in our scenes because of the magic of complex numbers. It is known that using 30 segments results in smooth low-polygon circles. So for a two-dimensional sphere a 30 by 30 segmented two-surface should look good. Set the segments equal to 30, and less curvy shapes will look even better in consequence. But, an animation extends through time frame by frame and so we need to set the total number of frames. In this way, specifying the number of frames determines the length of the video. For example, 1440 frames make a one-minute video at 24 frames per second.\n\n    figuresize = (1920, 1080)\n    segments = 30\n    frames_number = 1440\n\nA model means a complicated geometrical shape contained inside a graphical scene. Every model has a name to use as the file name of the output video. Here, we choose the name planethopf as we construct an alternative view of the Planet Hopf by Dror Bar-Natan (2010). Heinz Hopf in 1931 discovered a way to join circles over the skin of the globe. The discovery defines a fiber bundle where the base space is the spherical Earth and the fibers are circles. But, the circles are all mutually parallel and linked. Moreover, the Earth goes through a full rotation about the axis that connect the poles every 24 hours. So it is not surprising that the picture of a non-trivial bundle and the spinning of the base space coordinates (longitudes) makes for a ridiculous geometric shape. But, the surprising fact is that all of it is visualizable as a 3D object. Then, we use a dictionary that maps indices to names in order to keep track of boundary data on the globe and the name of each boundary as a sovereign country.\n\n    modelname = \"planethopf\"\n    indices = Dict()\n\nThe Hopf fibration, as a fiber bundle, has an inner product space. The inner product space is symmetric, linear and positive semidefinite. The last property means that the product of a point in the bundle with itself is always non-negative, and it is zero if and only if the point is the zero vector. The abstract inner product space allows us to talk about the length of vectors, the distance between two points and the idea of orthogonality between two vectors. A pair of vectors are orthogonal when they make a right angle with each other and as a consequence their product is equal to zero. For all u v v_1 v_2 in V and alpha beta in R the following are the properties of the abstract inner product space:\n\nSymmetric: u v = v u\nLinear: u alpha v_1 + beta v_2 = alpha u v_1 + beta u v_2\nPositive semidefinite: u u geq 0 for all u in V with u u = 0 if and only if u = 0\n\nNow, in order to skin the horizontal cross-sections of the bundle for visualization we need to start with a base point, which is denoted by x. At the tangent space of the base point q, the inner product space (characterized by a connection one-form) splits the tangent space of the bundle E at x into two linear subspaces: horizontal and vertical.\n\nT_q E = V_q E bigoplus H_q E\n\nIn terms of the connection, the two subspcaes are orthogonal. A chart is a four-tuple of real numbers to be used as a pair of closed intervals in the horizontal subspace. Then, using the exponential map one can travel in both horizontal and vertical directions and cover the whole bundle within the lengths of the chart intervals. Within the boundary of the chart and with an additional vertical coordinate (a gauge) we can define a tubular neighborhood of the base point q. The first two elements of the four-tuple chart give the interval along the first basis vector and the last two elements give the interval along the second basis vector. As for the third basis vector of the tangent space (the vertical subspace) we use a beginning and an ending gauge.\n\nFor the purpose of the construction of the Hopf fibration we define the bundle atlas of a general fiber bundle F to E xrightarrowpi M as an open covering U_i_i in I of the base manifold M together with bundle charts phi_i E_U_i to U_i times F. Putting the open covering with bundle charts a bundle atlas is denoted by U_i phi_i_i in I. The index i suggests that a bundle atlas should have more than one bundle chart whenever it is a non-trivial bundle (a twisted product rather than a Cartesian product). In order to cover the Hopf bundle we use the exponential matrix function supplied with linear combinations of elements from the Lie algebra so(4), which produces elements in the Lie group SO(4) that push a base point around the 3-sphere. As a side note, a Lie algebra is a vector space V that is equipped with the Lie bracket map sdot sdot V times V to V, with sdot sdot having three properties: bilinear, antisymmetric and satisfies the Jacobi identity. We choose a base point in the 3-sphere q in S^3 and then use Lie algebra elements before exponentiation in order to rotate the 3-sphere to cover every other point in the total space S^3 over the chart.\n\n    q = Quaternion(ℝ⁴(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0))\n    chart = (-π / 4, π / 4, -π / 4, π / 4)\n\nNext, we define five scalars in the Lie algebra of so(2), identified with imathbbR, in order to provide different gauge transformations for pullbacks by the Hopf fibration (whirls and base maps). The exponential function takes the gauge values to the unit circle S^1 = U(1) cong SO(2) given by exp(im * gauge). For creating a clearer view we are going to slice up the Hopf fibers (orbits) and set different values for their respective alpha channels. The names gauge1, gauge2, gauge3, gauge4 and gauge5 are used to provide the Hopf actions when we construct and update the shapes. 0.0 means the trivial action whereas 2π means the full orbit around a Hopf fiber. Looking at the values of these names we can see that a Hopf fiber will be cut into four quarters. We can make some quarters opaque and others see-through for better visibility.\n\n    gauge1 = 0.0\n    gauge2 = π / 2\n    gauge3 = float(π)\n    gauge4 = 3π / 2\n    gauge5 = 2π\n\nThe fundamental physics is based on the gauge symmetry of the product SU(3) times SU(2) times U(1) and the symmetry of spacetime as a Riemannian manifold M that is equipped with a metric. Therefore, physical laws in nature must be the same under two sets of choices: the choice of gauge transformations and the choice of an inertial reference frame in spacetime. In this model, we understand the choice of the guage symmetry by studying the Hopf action and the choice of an inertial frame in Minkowski space-time by a change-of-basis transformation on the Hopf bundle. The change-of-basis transformation is denoted by matrix M and is applied to the total space of the Hopf bundle via a matrix-vector product. Here, we initialize the matrix M with the idenity.\n\n    M = I(4)\n\nIn order to get the essence of these different choices and integrate them into a visual model we first note that Lorentz transformations of null vectors in the tangent space of spacetime is the same as transforming any other timelike (non-null) vectors. Second, The Hopf bundle of the 3-sphere has a representation in the Lie group S^3 = SU(2) and the Hopf action is represented by actions of S^1 = U(1) as a linear scalar multiplication on the right. But, null vectors have length zero in terms of the Lorentzian metric, whereas the Hopf bundle is made of vectors of unit length in terms of the Euclidean metric. Fortunately, these vectors coincide as unit quaternions and so their transformations can be unified into a single visual model. If we coordinatize a null vector in spacetime as u = 𝕍(T, X, Y, Z) then the corresponding quaternion q = Quaternion(T, X, Y, Z) takes the same coordinates. We assert that u is null and q is of unit norm, with an approximate equality check. The precision of the assertion is given by the name tolerance, which equals 1e-3.\n\n    T, X, Y, Z = vec(normalize(ℝ⁴(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)))\n    u = 𝕍(T, X, Y, Z)\n    q = Quaternion(T, X, Y, Z)\n    tolerance = 1e-3\n    @assert(isnull(u, atol = tolerance), \"u in not a null vector, $u.\")\n    @assert(isapprox(norm(q), 1, atol = tolerance), \"q in not a unit quaternion, $(norm(q)).\")\n\nThe camera is a viewport trough which we see the scene. It is a three-dimensional camera and much like a drone it has six features to help position and orient itself in the scene. Accordingly, a three-vector in the Euclidean 3-space E^3 determins its position in the scene, another 3-vector specifies the point at which it looks, and a third vector controls the up direction of the camera. The third 3-vector is needed because the camera can rotate through 360 degrees about the axis that connects its own position to the position of the subject. Using these three 3-vectors we control how far away we are from the subject, and how upright the subject is. \n\n    eyeposition = normalize(ℝ³(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)) * π * 0.8\n    lookat = ℝ³(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)\n    up = normalize(ℝ³(1.0, 0.0, 0.0))\n\nEach of the eyeposition, lookat and up vectors are in the three-real-dimensional vector space ℝ³. The structure of the abstract vector space of ℝ³ includes: associativity of addition, commutativity of addition, the zero vector, the inverse element, distributivity Ι, distributivity ΙΙ, associativity of scalar multiplication, and the unit scalar 1. Also, the product space associated with ℝ³ is symmetric, linear and positive semidefinite (see real3_tests.jl). The same goes for the structure of 4-vectors in ℝ⁴ as we are going to encounter in this model. An abstract vector space (V mathbbK + ) consists of four things:\n\nA set of vector-like objects V = u v \nA field mathbbK of scalar numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, or octonions (any one of the division algebras)\nAn addition operation + for elements of V that dictates how to add vectors: u + v\nA scalar multiplication operator  for scaling a vector by an element of the field\n\nAn abstract vector space satisfies eight axioms. For all vectors u v w in V and for all scalars alpha beta in mathbbK the following properties are true:\n\nAssociativity of addition: u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w\nCommutativity of addition: u + v = v + u\nThere exists a zero vector 0 in V such that u + 0 = 0 + u = u\nFor every u there exists an inverse element -u such that u + (-u) = u - u = 0\nDistributivity I: alpha (u + v) = alpha u + alpha v\nDistributivity II: (alpha + beta) u = alpha u + beta u\nAssociativity of scalar multiplication: alpha (beta u) = (alpha beta) u\nThere exists a unit scalar 1 such that 1u = u\n\nInterestingly, if the field mathbbK is an Octonian number then the axiom of the commutativity of addition becomes false. The plan is to first load a geographic data set, then construct a few shapes, and animate a four-stage transformation of the shapes. Model versioning can be applied here using different stages. The transformations are subgroups of the Lorentz transformation in the Minkowski vector space 𝕍, which is a tetrad and origin point away from the Minkowski space-time 𝕄. Both 𝕍 and 𝕄 inherit the properties of the abstract vector space. See minkowskivectorspace_tests.jl and minkowskispacetime_tests.jl for use cases.\n\n    totalstages = 4","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Load-the-Natural-Earth-Data","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Load the Natural Earth Data","text":"Next, we need to load two image files: an image to be used as a color reference, and another one to be used as surface texture for sections of the Hopf bundle. This is the first example of using FileIO to load image files from hard drive memory. Both images are made with a software called QGIS, which is a geographic information system software that is free and open-source. But, the data comes from Natural Earth Data. Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software. We downloaded the Admin 0 - Countries data file from the 1:10m Cultural Vectors link of the Downloads page. It is a large-scale map that contains geometry nodes and attributes.\n\n    reference = FileIO.load(\"data/basemap_color.png\")\n    mask = FileIO.load(\"data/basemap_mask.png\")\n\nAs for the image files, we paint the boundaries using the gemometry nodes, and add a grid to be able to visualize distortions of the Euclidean metric of the underlying surface. Therefore, the reference is the clean image from which we pick colors, whereas the mask has a grid and transparency for visualization purposes.\n\n    attributespath = \"data/naturalearth/geometry-attributes.csv\"\n    nodespath = \"data/naturalearth/geometry-nodes.csv\"\n    countries = loadcountries(attributespath, nodespath)\n\nThe geometry nodes of the data set consist of latitudes and longitudes of boundaries. But, geometry attributes feature various geographical, cultural, economical and geopolitical values. Of these features we only need the names and geographic coordinates. To not limit the use cases of this model, the generic function loadcountries loads all of the data features by supplying it with the file paths of attributes and nodes. Data versioning can be applied here using different file versions. The attributes and nodes files are comma-separated values.\n\nAt a high level of description, the process of loading boundary data is as follows: First, we use FileIO to open the attributes file. Second, we put the data in a DataFrames object to have in-memory tabular data. Third, sort the data according to shape identification. Fourth, open the nodes file in a DataFrame. Fifth, group the attributes by the name of each sovereign country. Sixth, determine the number of attribute groups by calling the generic function length. Seventh, define a constant ϵ = 5e-3 to limit the distance between nodes so that the computational complexity becomes more reasonable. Eighth, define a dictionary that has the keys: shapeid, name, gdpmd, gdpyear, economy, partid, and nodes. Finally, for each group of the attributes we extract the data corresponding to the dictionary keys and push them into array values.\n\nPart of the difficulty with the data loading process is that each sovereign country may have more than one connected component (closed boundary). That is why we store part identifications as one of the dictionary keys. In this process, the part with the greatest number of nodes is chosen as the main part and is pushed into the corresponding array value. All of the array values are ordered and have the same length so that indexing over the values of more than one key becomes easier. Once the part ID of each country name is determined, we make a subset of the data frame related to the part ID and then extract the geographic coordinates in terms of latitudes and longitudes. In fact, we make a histogram of each unique part ID and count the number of coordinates. The part ID with the greatest number of coordinates is selected for creating the subset of the data frame. Next, the coordinates are transformed into the Cartesian coordinate system from the Geographic one.\n\nFinally, we decimate a curve containing a sequence of coordinates by removing points from the curve that are farther from each other than the given threshold ϵ. It is a step to make sure that the boundary data has superb quality while managing the size of data for computation complexity. The generic function decimate implements the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm. It is an iterative end-point fit algorithm suggested by Dror Bar-Natan (2010) for this model. Since a boundary is modelled as a curve of line segments, we set a segmentation limit. But, the decimation process finds a curve that is similar in shape, yet has fewer number of points with the given threshold ϵ. In short, decimate recursively simplifies the segmented curve of a closed boundary if the maximum distance between a pair of consecutive points is greater than ϵ. The distance between two abstract vectors is given by d(u v) equiv u - v = sqrt(u - v) (u - v).\n\n    boundary_names = [\"United States of America\", \"Antarctica\", \"Australia\", \"Iran\", \"Canada\", \"Turkey\", \"New Zealand\", \"Mexico\", \"Pakistan\", \"Russia\"]\n    boundary_nodes = Vector{Vector{ℝ³}}()\n    for i in eachindex(countries[\"name\"])\n        for name in boundary_names\n            if countries[\"name\"][i] == name\n                push!(boundary_nodes, countries[\"nodes\"][i])\n                println(name)\n                indices[name] = length(boundary_nodes)\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\nAs the boundary data is massive in number (248 countries) we need to select a subset for visualization. 10 countries selected from a linear space of alphabetically sroted names should be representative of the whole Earth. Then again, using only three distinct points in the 2-sphere one can infer the transformations from the sphere into itself. Also, Antarctica should be added due to its special coordinates at the south pole, to give the user a better sense of how bundle sections are expanded and distorted. As soon as we have the names of the selection, we can proceed with populating the dictionary of indices that relates the name of each country with the corresponding index in boundary data. Using the dictionary we can read the attributes of countries by giving just the name as argument.\n\n    points = Vector{Quaternion}[]\n    for i in eachindex(boundary_nodes)\n        _points = Quaternion[]\n        for node in boundary_nodes[i]\n            r, θ, ϕ = convert_to_geographic(node)\n            push!(_points, q * Quaternion(exp(ϕ / 4 * K(1) + θ / 2 * K(2))))\n        end\n        push!(points, _points)\n    end\n\nWe instantiate a vector of a vector of type Quaternion to store boundary data. The outermost vector contains elements of different countries. But, the innermost vector contains the pullback of the geographic nodes by the Hopf map in the 3-sphere. After conversion to the Geographic coordinate system from the Cartesian coordinates, the points are pulled back by pi using the statement q * Quaternion(exp(ϕ / 4 * K(1) + θ / 2 * K(2))). It is a right multiplication of the base point q by the exponential function, supplied with the geographic coordinates θ and ϕ.

The pushforward of horizontal vectors by the Hopf map leaves them unchanged. However, vectors in the vertical subsapce of the tangent space of the Hopf bundle are in the kernel of the Hopf map (they are sent to zero).\n\nWe use a 64-bit floating point number to parameterize an element of the Lie algebra so(2), before exponentiating it into an element of the Lie group SO(2) to be used for the orbit map phi S^1 to S^3, because a local horizontal cross-section uses the same scalar number for the entirety of subset U subset S^2. The subset U is bounded with a two-dimensional chart. A chart can be thought of as a rectangle whose sides are at most π in length. But, the length of a great circle of the three-dimensional sphere is 2π and the maximum length of chart sides is limited, unless we want to cover S^3 twice. To keep things simple, we use one bundle chart and cover a subset U of side length π. The Hopf bundle does not admit a global section. After exponentiating the base point q in horizontal directions for a magnitude beyond π, the orientation of the surface reverses and a sharp twist of the surface happens.\n\nThe Hopf bundle is embedded in ℝ⁴, the real-four-dimensional space. The coordinates are defined as unit quaternions where the basis vectors are represented by the symmetry group of the rotations of an orthogonal tetrad, namely SO(4). vectors u and v are orthogonal if and only if their inner product equals zero u v = 0. When we talk about Hopf actions and bundle charts, we talk about values that are used to linearly combine elements of the Lie algebra of so(4), vectors in the tangent space of the bundle at point x. Then, we use the matrix exponential map for computing Lie group values in SO(4). Given a fixed gauge, a point in the Lie group stemming from base point x is reconstructed from a Lie algebra element by executing the statement x * Quaternion(exp(θ * K(1) + -ϕ * K(2)) * exp(gauge * K(3))), where scalars θ and ϕ denote the latitude and longitude components in the bundle chart, respectively. K(1) and K(2) denote 4x4 matrices with real elements as basis vectors of the Lie algebra so(4). The tangent space of the bundle at point x spans horizontally with the exponential map of a linear combination of basis vectors K(1) and K(2), whereas it spans vertically in the K(3) direction. This way we get a strictly horizontal section of the bundle in terms of elements of the Lie group SO(4), given a gauge. The elements of SO(4) go on to push the base point x around and end up as observables to be rendered graphically.\n\n    lspaceθ = range(chart[1], stop = chart[2], length = segments)\n    lspaceϕ = range(chart[3], stop = chart[4], length = segments)\n    [project(normalize(M * (x * Quaternion(exp(θ * K(1) + -ϕ * K(2)) * exp(gauge * K(3)))))) for ϕ in lspaceϕ, θ in lspaceθ]\n\nUsing the eigendecomposition method LinearAlgebra.eigen, we can compute the matrix M to change the basis of the bundle while keeping the coordinates invariant. So the change-of-basis is the final step of the construction of the observables after using the geographic coordinates and the gauge. Observables.jl allows us to define the points that are to be rendered in the scene, in a way that they can listen to changes dynamically. Later, when we apply transformations to the bundle, including the change-of-basis, the idea is to only change the top-level observables and avoid reconstructing the scene entirely. The change of basis is a bilinear transformation of the tetrad (of Minkowski space-time 𝕄) in ℝ⁴ as a matrix-vector product (M * x for example). Here we denote the transformation as matrix M, which takes a Quaternion number as input and spits out a new number of the same type. The input and output bases must be orthonormal as the numbers must remain unit quaternions after the transformation. Constructing a base map requires a few arguments: the scene object, the base point q, the gauge, the change-of-basis transformation M, the chart, the number of segments of the lattice of observables, the tuxture of the surface and the optional transparency setting. Construct four base maps in order to visualize a more complete picture of the Hopf fibration using four different sections.

As a reminder, boundaries on the map of the Earth are specified by two real values: latitude θ and longitude ϕ. The boundary of each country in boundary_names is lifted up from the base manifold using the following statement: q * Quaternion(exp(ϕ / 4 * K(1) + θ / 2 * K(2))). The pullback operation is realized by pushing the base point q in a horizontal direction given by coordinates on the surface of the Earth. Then, a gauge transformation is applied by executing the statement x * Quaternion(exp(K(3) * gauge)), with the given scalar gauge in the direction K(3) of the tangent space at point x of the bundle. By varying gauge in a linear space of floating point values, a Whirl (a pullback by the Hopf map) takes a three-dimensional volume. In the special case where gauge is a range of values, starting at zero and stopping at 2π, the Whirl makes a Hopf band. The degree of the twist in the band is directly proportional to the value of gauge. Multiplying x on the right by the exponentiation of K(3) * gauge pushes x in the vertical subspace of the bundle and makes an orbit. Therefore, the orbit map phi S^1 to S^3 is given by x[i] * Quaternion(exp(K(3) * gauge).\n\n    lspacegauge = range(gauge1, stop = gauge2, length = segments)\n    [project(normalize(M * (x[i] * Quaternion(exp(K(3) * gauge))))) for i in 1:length(x), gauge in lspacegauge]\n\nThere are four sets of whirls: some whirls are more solid and some whirls are more transparent.

It also helps to visualize the direction of the null plane under transformations of the bundle. Since every pair of points that are infinitestimally close to each other in a horizontal cross-section, defines a differential operator. And Hopf actions, transformations from the bundle into itself change the direction of the operator as it twists. The operator is also called a spin-vector in Minkowski vector space 𝕍. Therefore it can be visualized directly how the operator changes sign by comparing a pullback into S^3 at antipodal points of an orbit.\n\n    whirls1 = []\n    whirls2 = []\n    whirls3 = []\n    whirls4 = []\n    for i in eachindex(boundary_nodes)\n        color1 = getcolor(boundary_nodes[i], reference, 0.1)\n        color2 = getcolor(boundary_nodes[i], reference, 0.2)\n        color3 = getcolor(boundary_nodes[i], reference, 0.3)\n        color4 = getcolor(boundary_nodes[i], reference, 0.4)\n        whirl1 = Whirl(lscene, points[i], gauge1, gauge2, M, segments, color1, transparency = true)\n        whirl2 = Whirl(lscene, points[i], gauge2, gauge3, M, segments, color2, transparency = true)\n        whirl3 = Whirl(lscene, points[i], gauge3, gauge4, M, segments, color3, transparency = true)\n        whirl4 = Whirl(lscene, points[i], gauge4, gauge5, M, segments, color4, transparency = true)\n        push!(whirls1, whirl1)\n        push!(whirls2, whirl2)\n        push!(whirls3, whirl3)\n        push!(whirls4, whirl4)\n    end\n\nThe color of a Whirl should match the color of the inside of its own boundary at every horizontal section, also known as a base map. The generic function getcolor finds the correct color to set for the Whirl. It takes as input a closed boundary (a vector of Cartesian points), a color reference image and an alpha channel value to produce an RGBA 4-color. getcolor finds a color according to the following steps: First, it determines the number of points in the given boundary. Second, gets the size of the reference color image as height and width in pixels. Third, converts all of the boundary points to Geographic coordinates. Fourth, finds the minimum and maximum values of the latitudes and longitudes of the boundary. Fifth, creates a two-dimensional linear space (a flat grid or lattice) that ranges within the upper and lower bounds of the latitudes and longitudes. Sixth, finds the Cartesian two-dimensional coordinates of the points in the image space by normalizing the geographic coordinates and multiplying them by the image size. Seventh, picks the color of each grid point with the Cartesian two-dimensional coordinates in the image space as the index. Eighth, Makes a histogram of the colors by counting the number of each color. Finally, sorts the histogram and picks the color with the greatest number of occurance. (See earth.jl from the src directory for implementation.)\n\nHowever, step seven makes sure that the coordinates in the linear 2-space are inside the closed boundary, otherwise it skips the index and continues with the next index in the grid. In this way we don't pick colors from the boundaries of neighboring countries over the globe. The generic function isinside is used by getcolor to determine whether the given point is inside the given boundary or not. But first, the boundary needs to become a polygon in the Euclidean 2-space of coordinates in terms of latitude and longitude. This is the same as geographic coordinates with the radius of Earth set equal to 1 identically, hence the spherical Earth model of the ancient Greeks. After we make a polygon out of the boundary, the generic function rayintersectseg determines whther a ray cast from a point of the linear grid intersects an edge with the given point p and edge. Here, p is a two-dimensional point and edge is a tuple of such points, representing a line segment. Eventhough this algorithm should work in theory, some boundaries are too small to yield a definite color via getcolor and the color inference algorithm returns a false negative in those cases. So the default color may be white for a limited number of cases out of 248 countries. Once we have the color of the whirls, we can proceed to construct the whirls by supplying the generic function Whirl with the following arguments: the scene object, the boundary points lifetd via an arbitrary section, the first fiber action value (gauge), the second action value, the change-of-basis function M, the number of surface segments, the color and the optional transparency setting.","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Compute-a-Four-Screw","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Compute a Four-Screw","text":"We are going to execute a motion around a closed loop in the Lie group SL(2 mathbbC), and then multiply every point in the Hopf bundle by an element of the loop. A four-screw is a subset of the Lie group SL(n mathbbK) = A in Mat(n times n mathbbK)  det(A) = 1, square matrices of Complex numbers whose volume form (determinant) equals 1. Here, the number n = 2 and the field mathbbK = mathbbC. A four-screw is a kind of restricted Lorentz transformation where a z-boost and a proper rotation of the celestial sphere are applied. The transformation lives in a four-complex dimensional space and it has six degrees of freedom (the same number of dimensions as SO(4)). By parameterizing a four-screw one can control how much boost and rotation a transformation shuld have. Here, w as a positive scalar controls the amount of boost, whereas angle ψ controls the rotation component of the transform. But, the parameterization accepts rapidity as input for the boost. So we take the natural logarithm of w (log(w) = phi) in order to supply the transformer with the required rapidity argument. First, we set w equal to one in order to preserve the scale of the Argand plane and animate the angle ψ through zero to 2π for rotation.

The length or norm of an abstract vector u in V is equivalent to the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself: u u equiv sqrtu u in R. The inner product of vectors u and v in an abstract vector space is given by u^T * g_munu * v, where g_munu denotes the metric 2-tensor. However, as an instantiation in Minkowski vector space 𝕍 with signature (+, -, -, -), the matrix g_munu is a diagonal of the form: g_munu = beginbmatrix 1  0  0  0  0  -1  0  0  0  0  -1  0  0  0  0  -1 endbmatrix.\n\nFurthermore, a vector in 𝕍 is in the tangent space at some point in Einstein's spacetime, where the metric g_munu will not be diagonal in general. Since a Lorentz transformation of null vectors has the same effect on vectors that are not null, it makes the visualization easier to study transformations on null vectors only. On the other hand, in the Euclidean 4-space E^4 the metric g_munu is replaced by identity matrix of dimension four. The null vectors that we use here in the Minkowski vector space have length zero in terms of the Lorentz norm, but have Euclidean norm equal to one, and so they can be regarded as elements of unit Quaternion. Therefore, what we are animating here is the transformation of unit quaternions that represent null vectors. \n\nThe change-of-basis transformations that we have used to instantiate Whirl and Basemap types above, can accomodate the effects of a Lorentz transformation. Then, by setting ψ and ϕ we can define a generic function transform to take Quaternion numbers as input and to give us the transformed number as output.\n\n    transform(x::Quaternion) = begin\n        T, X, Y, Z = vec(x)\n        X̃ = X * cos(ψ) - Y * sin(ψ)\n        Ỹ = X * sin(ψ) + Y * cos(ψ)\n        Z̃ = Z * cosh(ϕ) + T * sinh(ϕ)\n        T̃ = Z * sinh(ϕ) + T * cosh(ϕ)\n        Quaternion(T̃, X̃, Ỹ, Z̃)\n    end\n\nEvery transformation in an abstract vector space such as the Minkowski vector space 𝕍 has a matrix representation. For constructing the matrix of the transform we just need to compute it four times with basis vectors. The transformation of the basis vectors of unit quaternions by transform are denoted by r₁, r₂, r₃ and r₄. The matrix _M is a four by four real matrix whose rows are r₁ through r₄. _M is the matrix representation of the transformation that is induced by transform.\n\n    r₁ = transform(Quaternion(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0))\n    r₂ = transform(Quaternion(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0))\n    r₃ = transform(Quaternion(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0))\n    r₄ = transform(Quaternion(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0))\n    _M = reshape([vec(r₁); vec(r₂); vec(r₃); vec(r₄)], (4, 4))\n\nBut, _M doesn't necessarily take unit quaternions to unit quaternions. By decomposing _M into eigenvalues and eigenvectors we can manipulate the transformation so that it takes unit quaternions to unit quaternions without modifying its effect on the geometrical structure of Argand plane. Despite the fact that _M is a matrix of real numbers, it has complex eigenvalues, as it involves a rotation. By constructing a four-complex-dimensional vector off of the eigenvalues we can normalize _M by normalizing the vector of eigenvalues, before reconstructing a unimodular, unitary transformation (a normal matrix). The reconstructed matrix is called M.\n\n    decomposition = LinearAlgebra.eigen(_M)\n    λ = LinearAlgebra.normalize(decomposition.values) # normalize eigenvalues for a unimodular transformation\n    Λ = [λ[1] 0.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 λ[2] 0.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 λ[3] 0.0; 0.0 0.0 0.0 λ[4]]\n    M = real.(decomposition.vectors * Λ * LinearAlgebra.inv(decomposition.vectors))\n\nWe can assert that the transformation that is induced by M takes null vectors to null vectors in Minkowski vector space 𝕍. If that is the case, then the reconstructed transformation M is a faithful representation and it only scales the extent of null vectors rather than null directions, compared to _M. A representation f is called a faithful representation when for different numbers g and q, f(g) and f(q) are equal if and only if g = q.\n\nA spin-vector is based on the space of future or past null directions in Minkowski space-time. The field ζ of a SpinVector represents points in Argand plane. Therefore, if v is obtained with the transformation of u by M, then the respective spin-vectors s and s′ should tell us how M changes Argand plane. To be precise, three different points in Argand plane, namely u₁, u₂, u₃, are needed to characterize the transformation. We assert that the transformation by M induced on Argand plane is correct, because it extends the Argand plane ζ = w * exp(im * ψ) * s.ζ by magnitude w and rotates it through angle ψ. So, we established the fact that normalizing the vector of eigenvalues of the transformation _M and reconstructing it to get M leaves the effect on Argand plane invariant.\n\n    u₁ = 𝕍(1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0)\n    u₂ = 𝕍(1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)\n    u₃ = 𝕍(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)\n    for u in [u₁, u₂, u₃]\n        v = 𝕍(vec(M * Quaternion(u.a)))\n        @assert(isnull(v, atol = tolerance), \"v ∈ 𝕍 in not null, $v.\")\n        s = SpinVector(u)\n        s′ = SpinVector(v)\n        if s.ζ == Inf # A Float64 number (the point at infinity)\n            ζ = s.ζ\n        else # A Complex number\n            ζ = w * exp(im * ψ) * s.ζ\n        end\n        ζ′ = s′.ζ\n        if ζ′ == Inf\n            ζ = real(ζ)\n        end\n        @assert(isapprox(ζ, ζ′, atol = tolerance), \"The transformation induced on Argand plane is not correct, $ζ != $ζ′.\")\n    end\n\nA distinction between coordinates in Argand plane becomes relevant when we want to assert the properties of M on a test variable ζ, without applying M on a control variable ζ′. In the special case where the null direction ζ is the point at infinity, the north pole, we expect for the transformation induced by M to be inconsequential. Because ζ is a union of complex numbers and the singleton of infinity (of type Union{Complex, ComplexF64, Float64}). For an inhomogeneous coordinate system we treat the point at infinity in a different way. For example, for all values of w, if ζ equals infinity then the rotation component of a four-screw should not have any effect on the north pole. But, multiplying positive infinity by a complex number of negative magnitude makes ζ equal to negative infinity, which is not in Argand plane. In that case, we first check the edge case to leave ζ unchanged whenever its value is infinity, ζ = s.ζ. No amount of z-boost and rotation about the z-axis should transform the north pole. Else, ζ transforms as expected: ζ = w * exp(im * ψ) * s.ζ.","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Compute-a-Null-Rotation","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Compute a Null Rotation","text":"To understand a null rotation, imagine that you are an astronaut in empty space, far away from any celestial object.

The animation of a null rotation is correct if all of the assertions evaluate true.\n\n    v₁ = 𝕍(normalize(ℝ⁴(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)))\n    v₂ = 𝕍(vec(M * Quaternion(vec(v₁))))\n    @assert(isnull(v₁, atol = tolerance), \"vector t + z in not null, $v₁.\")\n    @assert(isapprox(v₁, v₂, atol = tolerance), \"The null vector t + z is not invariant under the null rotation, $v₁ != $v₂.\")","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Update-the-Camera","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Update the Camera","text":"The 3D camera of the scene requires the eye position, look at, and up vectors for positioning and orientation.

Then, we use M to update base maps 1, 2, 3 and 4. For we want to have different choices of an inertial reference frame in the tangent space of some point in spacetime. The generic function update! updates base maps by changing the structurally embedded observables, and then the graphical shapes take different forms accordingly.\n\nAlthough we are talking about points in the bundle, embedded in ℝ⁴ and of type Quaternion, the generic function project converts them to points in ℝ³. The one method of project takes the given point q ∈ S³ ⊂ ℂ² and turns it into a point in the Euclidean space E³ ⊂ ℝ³ using stereographic projection. We identify mathbbR^4 to mathbbC^2 given by (x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4) mapsto (x_1 + i x_2 x_3 + i x_4). Then, the stereographic projection is given by: project S^3 setminus (1 0) to mathbbR^3 given by (x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4) mapsto fracx_2 x_3 x_4^T1 - x_1.\n\nWhenever we call the update! function with an object like basemap1, giving transformation M, two things happn under the hood for deforming the graphics (update!(basemap1, q, gauge1, M)). First, a matrix of type ℝ³ is made, Matrix{ℝ³}. That is the job of one of the methods of the generic function make. The correct dispatch is selected automatically for the job, based on the argument signature (whether the first argument is of type Whirl or Basemap for example). The selected method makes a 2-surface (lattice) of the horizontal section at base point q after transforming by M, with the given segments number, gauge and chart. A chart and a gauge play the role of a choice of local trivialization of the Hopf bundle, as an atlas, for the purpose of constructing a pullback of the Earth's surface.\n\nSecond, the matrix of ℝ³ along with the given basemap's observables are passed to the function updatesurface! for updating the observables. For each coordinate component x, y and z in the Euclidean 3-space E^3, there is a corresponding matrix of real numbers, of the same size: (segments by segments). In the type structure of a Basemap or a Whirl there is a tuple whose elements are of type Observable. Each element of the three-tuple in turn contains a matrix of components x, y or z. Reshaping a matrix of 3-vectors into three matrices of scalars is done because when we implicitly instantiated a GLMakie surface in the beginning, we supplied it with three observables representing x, y and z coordinates separately. The generic function buildsurface from the source file surface.jl builds a surface with the given scene, value, color and transparency. Here, the value argument is of type Matrix{ℝ³}. The interface between the construction of our base maps (or whirls) and the graphics engine is essentially a reshaping and type conversion. See surface_tests.jl for use cases.\n\nEvery time we update the observables of a Whirl under transformation by M, we need to access the coordinates of the boundary data (update!(whirls1[i], points[i], gauge1, gauge2, M)). But the coordinates are not changed, and instead the change-of-basis is taken care of by the map M. The coordinate component ϕ is divided by a factor of four since in geographic coordinates longitudes range from -π to +π, whereas latitudes range from -π / 2 to +π / 2 (exp(ϕ / 4 * K(1) + θ / 2 * K(2)))). This division rescales the longitude component of coordinates and allows us to have a square bundle chart, compared to coordinate components θ. Rescaling θ and ϕ aligns the boundaries of horizontal and vertical subspaces. We finish the animation of one time-step after updating the last Whirl.\n\nThe function animate takes as input an integer called frame and updates the scene observables according to the stages that we described earlier. First, it calculates the progress of the animation frames, dividing frame by frames_number. For different properties of Lorentz transformations we have four stages, each stage having its own progress. The signature of the four-screw animator function is compute_fourscrew(progress::Float64, status::Int). For example, stage one animates a proper rotation of Argand plane by calling the function compute_fourscrew with status equal to 1. Stage 2 animates a pure z-boost. Then, stage 3 animates a four-screw. Finally, stage 4 animates a null rotation by calling the function compute_nullrotation. After calling each stage function, we update the camera by calling the function updatecamera.\n\n    animate(frame::Int) = begin\n        progress = frame / frames_number\n        stage = min(totalstages - 1, Int(floor(totalstages * progress))) + 1\n        stageprogress = totalstages * (progress - (stage - 1) * 1.0 / totalstages)\n        println(\"Frame: $frame, Stage: $stage, Total Stages: $totalstages, Progress: $stageprogress\")\n        if stage == 1\n            M = compute_fourscrew(stageprogress, 1)\n        elseif stage == 2\n            M = compute_fourscrew(stageprogress, 2)\n        elseif stage == 3\n            M = compute_fourscrew(stageprogress, 3)\n        elseif stage == 4\n            M = compute_nullrotation(stageprogress)\n        end\n        update!(basemap1, q, gauge1, M)\n        update!(basemap2, q, gauge2, M)\n        update!(basemap3, q, gauge3, M)\n        update!(basemap4, q, gauge4, M)\n        for i in eachindex(whirls1)\n            update!(whirls1[i], points[i], gauge1, gauge2, M)\n            update!(whirls2[i], points[i], gauge2, gauge3, M)\n            update!(whirls3[i], points[i], gauge3, gauge4, M)\n            update!(whirls4[i], points[i], gauge4, gauge5, M)\n        end\n        updatecamera()\n    end\n\nTo create an animation you need to use the record function. In summary, we instantiated a Scene inside a Figure. Next, we created and animated observables in the scene, on a frame by frame basis. Now, we record the scene by passing the figure fig, the file path of the resulting video, and the range of frame numbers to the record function. The frame is incremented by record and the frame number is passed to the function write to animate the observables. Once the frame number reaches the total number of animation frames, recording is finished and a video file is saved on the hard drive at the file path: gallery/planethopf.mp4.\n\n

= \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nرباتی که در اینجا می‌سازیم، یک ربات تعادلی تک چرخ است. همان‌طور که از نام آن پیداست، این ربات تنها دارای یک چرخ بوده و بنابراین یک نقطه‌ی تماس با زمین دارد. به همین دلیل پیچیدگی آن بیشتر از ربات‌های تعادلی دوچرخ است. در حقیقت این ربات باید تعادل خود را در دو راستا و حول دو محور حفظ کند. در این ربات حرکت به جلو و عقب و حفظ تعادل در این جهت‌ها همانند یک ربات تعادلی دوچرخ است و بر پایه‌ی همان اصول فیزیکی استوار است. اما با توجه به این که چرخ ربات هیچ حرکتی در جهت‌های چپ و راست ندارد، برای حفظ کردن تعادل در این راستا باید از مولد گشتاور دیگری استفاده شود. به این منظور از یک جرم چرخان که به طور معمول چرخ عکس‌العملی خوانده می‌شود کمک می‌گیریم. اصول عملکرد این جرم چرخان که در قسمت بالای ربات نصب شده است، به این صورت است که اگر به آن گشتاوری وارد کنیم تا به چرخش درآید، آن جرم نیز گشتاوری که از نظر اندازه برابر با گشتاور وارد شده است به عنوان عکس‌العمل بر ربات وارد می‌کند. یکی از اصل‌های فیزیکی به نام پایستگی اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی این رخداد را توجیه می‌کند. طبق این اصل، مجموع اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی یک مجموعه به دور یک محور مشخص بدون تغییر باقی می‌ماند، مگر آنکه یک گشتاور خارجی به آن وارد شود. بنابراین اگر یکی از اجزای این مجموعه در اثر گشتاور داخلی شروع به چرخش کند، بقیه‌ی اجزای مجموعه با چرخش در جهت عکس، تاثیر آن را خنثی می‌کنند. در غیر این صورت اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی پایسته نخواهد ماند. با کمک این گشتاور عکس‌العمل می‌توانیم زاویه‌ی ربات را به دو طرف چپ یا راست تحت کنترل بگیریم.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nربات تعادلی تک چرخ ممکن است چندان کاربردی به نظر نیاید، اما همانند ربات تعادلی دوچرخ، یا انواع پاندول‌های معکوس، شرایط مناسبی را برای آزمایش کردن و بررسی الگوریتم‌های مختلف کنترلی فراهم می‌کند. علاوه‌براین، مهم‌ترین جزء این ربات که چرخ عکس‌العملی آن است کاربرد خاصی در ماهواره‌ها دارد. پس از آنکه یک ماهواره در مدار زمین قرار داده شد، تنها نیروی وارد شونده بر آن نیروی جاذبه است. بنابراین کنترلی بر حرکت خود نخواهد داشت. برای آنکه ماهواره بتواند در مسیر حرکت خود مانورهای کوچکی داشته باشد، یا آنکه مدار خود را به اندازه‌ی کوچکی اصلاح کند، به طور معمول آن را حداقل به یکی از سه سیستم محرکه مجهز می‌کنند: موشک پیش‌راننده، گشتاور دهنده‌ی مغناطیسی، یا چرخ عکس‌العملی. مورد اول خارج از بحث ماست. نحوه‌ی به کار گیری چرخ عکس‌العملی در ماهواره به این صورت است که ماهواره می‌تواند برای جهت‌گیری به یک سمت معین، چرخ داخلی خود را در جهت عکس به مقدار لازم بچرخاند. میزان این چرخش بر اساس نسبت ممان اینرسی دورانی ماهواره و چرخ تعیین می‌شود. برای کنترل چرخش ماهواره در تمامی جهت‌ها لازم است ماهواره به سه چرخ که روی محورهای عمود بر هم نصب شده‌اند مجهز باشد. موتورسواران حرفه‌ای نیز از این خاصیت پایستگی اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی بهره می‌گیرند. هنگامی که یک موتورسوار پرش کرده و از زمین جدا می‌شود، تنها نیروی وارد شونده به آن جاذبه‌ی زمین است که خارج از کنترل موتورسوار می‌باشد. در این وضعیت، موتورسوار با افزایش دادن سرعت چرخ عقب خود یا کاهش دادن آن (ترمز گرفتن) می‌تواند زاویه‌ی فرود خود را تنظیم کند. تاثیر گشتاور عکس‌العمل که از چرخ عقب به بدنه‌ی موتور وارد می‌شود، کل مجموعه را به سمت بالا یا پایین می‌چرخاند. برای ساختن این ربات لازم است با ساختار مکانیکی، مدل‌سازی ریاضی، الگوریتم‌های کنترلی، طراحی دیجیتال و مدارهای الکترونیکی آن آشنا شوید.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<h2>\n\nسیستم سنجش موقعیت بر پایه‌ی اینرسی\n\n</h2>\n<p>\n\nکنترل و ناوبری یک ربات متحرک بدون دانستن موقعیت آن میسر نیست. بدین منظور سنسورهای گوناگونی طراحی و ساخته شده‌اند که هر یک با توجه به کاربرد خاص خود به کار گرفته می‌شوند. از جمله انواع سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یابی می‌توان شتاب‌سنج‌های دقیق مورد استفاده در موشک‌ها، ژیروسکوپ‌های موجود در ماشین‌های پرنده، ارتفاع‌سنج‌ها، سیستم‌های جهت‌یابی بر اساس میدان مغناطیسی زمین، سیستم‌های موقعیت یابی بر پایه‌ی سامانه‌ی موقعیت‌یاب جهانی، سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یابی به وسیله‌ی شبکه‌های بیسیم الکترومغناطیسی یا صوتی، و حتی سیستم‌های بسیار پیچیده‌ی موقعیت‌یابی بر پایه‌ی تصویر ستارگان که در ماهواره‌ها و فضاپیماها مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد، را نام برد.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nامروزه حس‌گرهای الکترومکانیکی در ابعاد بسیار کوچک (میکرومتری) ساخته می‌شوند. این فناوری با نام سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی شناخته می‌شود. ظهور فناوری سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی تاثیر شگرفی در کاهش اندازه و قیمت انواع سنسورهای الکترومکانیکی و افزایش دقت آن‌ها داشته است. این مساله امکان استفاده از چندین سنسور را در یک ربات کوچک فراهم می‌کند. حتی در برخی موارد، سازندگان چندین سنسور موقعیت‌یاب (مانند شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ) را در قالب یک تراشه‌ی واحد عرضه می‌کنند.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nاز میان ادوات موقعیت‌یابی، سنسورهای اندازه‌گیری شتاب، سرعت دورانی (ژیروسکوپ)، و میدان مغناطیسی از پرکاربردترین لوازم به کار گرفته شده در ربات‌های خودگردان کوچک می‌باشند. تمرکز این بخش بر ماژول شتاب‌سنج و ماژول ژیروسکوپ است. با استفاده از شتاب‌سنج می‌توانید شتاب حرکت ربات و همچنین سرعت و موقعیت آن را (از طریق انتگرال‌گیری) محاسبه کنید. لازم است بدانید که شتاب جاذبه‌ی زمین نیز در اندازه‌گیری یک شتاب‌سنج تاثیر می‌گذارد. این مساله موقعیت‌یابی را دشوار می‌سازد، اما برای اندازه‌گیری انحراف نسبت به مسیر جاذبه (خط عمود) سودمند است. ژیروسکوپ نیز به طور اساسی سرعت زاویه‌ای را اندازه‌گیری می‌کند که با انتگرال‌گیری، موقعیت زاویه‌ای (جهت) نیز قابل محاسبه خواهد بود. بدین ترتیب با کمک شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ امکان اندازه‌گیری موقعیت و جهت ربات متحرک شما و به طور مخصوص سنجش میزان انحراف آن نسبت به خط عمود (راستای جاذبه) فراهم است.\n\n</p>\n<h3>\n\nشتاب‌سنج\n\n</h3>\n<p>\n\nتمامی شتاب‌سنج‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی به شیوه‌ای دربرگیرنده‌ی یک جرم متحرک داخلی هستند که تحت تاثیر نیروی خارجی به حرکت درمی‌آید. این جرم توسط یک ساختار فنر مانند در جای خود نگه داشته می‌شود و میزان جابجایی آن در اثر نیروی خارجی وارد شده، توسط روش‌های متفاوتی مانند تغییر اثر خازنی اندازه‌گیری می‌شود. سپس با دانستن ثابت استحکام سازه فنری و میزان جرم متحرک، این جابجایی به معادل شتاب آن تبدیل می‌شود. با توجه به این توضیحات، شتاب‌سنج‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی به طور ذاتی نیروی خارجی وارد شده بر جرم متحرک را اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند. به همین علت، تمامی این نوع شتاب‌سنج‌ها شتاب استاتیک (جاذبه‌ی زمین) و شتاب دینامیک (ناشی از تغییرات سرعت) را به یک شکل اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند و تفکیک کردن این دو مقدار اندازه‌گیری شده بیانگر شتاب ناشی از حرکت به علاوه شتاب جاذبه می‌باشد، و اگر راستای اندازه‌گیری حسگر در جهت افقی (عمود بر جاذبه‌ی زمین) باشد، تنها شتاب دینامیک سنجیده می‌شود و جاذبه تاثیری بر اندازه‌گیری نخواهد داشت. پس در صورتی که در یک سیستم از یک شتاب‌سنج تک محوره (با قابلیت اندازه‌گیری در یکی از جهت‌های مختصات) استفاده می‌شود، لازم است زاویه‌ی قرارگیری آن نسبت به راستای جاذبه مشخص باشد تا تاثیر شتاب استاتیک قابل محاسبه باشد.\n\n</p>‌\n<p>\n\nحال تصور کنید دو یا سه شتاب‌سنج در اختیار دارید که راستای اندازه‌گیری آن‌ها دو-به-دو نسبت به هم عمود است (مانند محورهای مختصات ایکس، ایگرگ و زد در دستگاه استاندارد دکارتی). اگر سرعت حرکت این مجموعه ثابت باشد و تنها شتاب استاتیک ناشی از جاذبه به آن وارد شود، با مقایسه‌ی نسبت شتاب اندازه‌گیری شده توسط هر یک از محورها، زاویه‌ی قرارگیری این مجموعه نسبت به راستای جاذبه قابل محاسبه است. این روشی است که در بسیاری از ترازهای الکترونیکی و ربات‌های متحرک برای سنجش زاویه‌ی قرارگیری نسبت به راستای جاذبه مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nاستفاده از شتاب‌سنج دو محوره برای اندازه‌گیری راستای جاذبه‌ی زمین در صفحه‌ی عمود بر

صفحه‌ی افق و راستای جاذبه با استفاده از رابطه‌های داده شده قابل محاسبه کردن است. توجه کنید که دانستن زاویه‌های میان هر محور با راستای جاذبه، موقعیت زاویه‌ای کلی شتاب‌سنج در فضای سه‌بعدی را به دست نمی‌دهد. در واقع اگر این شتاب‌سنج حول محوری به موازات جاذبه دوران داده شود، هر سه محور آن نتایج یکسانی را نسبت به قبل اندازه‌گیری خواهند کرد. برای آنکه موقعیت زاویه‌ای شتاب‌سنج به طور کامل معلوم شود، لازم است حداقل دو بردار معلوم ناموازی (بردار جاذبه و یک بردار دیگر) توسط آن اندازه‌گیری شود. در هر حال، با استفاده از شتاب‌سنج سه‌محوره می‌توان یک تراز الکترونیکی با قابلیت اندازه‌گیری شیب در دو

عمود بر هم در یک بسته‌بندی واحد تشکیل شده‌اند.\n\n</p>\n‌<p>\n\nیکی از اشکالات اساسی استفاده از شتاب‌سنج برای سنجش میزان انحراف، تاثیر شتاب دینامیک (ناشی از تغییرات سرعت) در اندازه‌گیری جهت است. به عنوان مثال، اگر چنین دستگاهی را در یک اتومبیل نصب کنید و بخواهید شیب جاده را اندازه‌گیری کنید، تا زمانی که سرعت اتومبیل ثابت باشد، راستای اندازه‌گیری شده صحیح است. اما هنگامی که سرعت اتومبیل تغییر می‌کند، بردار شتاب دینامیک با بردار شتاب استاتیک جمع شده و دستگاه اندازه‌گیر شما راستای این بردار جدید را می‌سنجد (که متفاوت از راستای جاذبه‌ی زمین است). از دیگر معایب شتاب‌سنج‌ها حساسیت زیاد به لرزش و تولید نتایج نویزدار است.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: estimating_the_road_slope)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n‌<p>\n\nسنجش شیب جاده از طریق اندازه‌گیری راستای جاذبه توسط شتاب‌سنجی که در اتومبیل تعبیه شده است. حرکت ماشین در شکل (الف) با شتاب مثبت (افزایش سرعت)، در شکل (ب) بدون شتاب (سرعت ثابت)، و در شکل (ج) با شتاب منفی (ترمز) انجام می‌شود. همانطور که می‌بینید، تنها در شکل (ب) راستای شتاب جاذبه و شیب جاده درست اندازه‌گیری می‌شوند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n‌<p>\n\nحساسیت به لرزش و وابستگی به شتاب دینامیک، کمک گرفتن از حسگرهای دیگر مانند ژیروسکوپ و حسگر میدان مغناطیسی (قطب‌نمای الکترونیکی) را برای اندازه‌گیری راستای جاذبه‌ی زمین ضروری می‌سازد.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبرای انتخاب یک شتاب‌سنج باید به محدوده ی لازم برای اندازه‌گیری، سرعت نمونه‌برداری، نحوه‌ی ارتباط با آن (آنالوگ یا دیجیتال و پروتکل ارتباطی) و همچنین تعداد محورهای لازم برای پروژه‌ی خود (یک‌بعدی، دوبعدی و سه‌بعدی) توجه نمایید. پارامترهای دیگری که در شتاب‌سنج‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی باید مورد توجه قرار گیرند، حساسیت به تغییرات دما و ولتاژ تغذیه، و وجود آفست اولیه (مقدار خوانده شده در شتاب صفر) است که باید با کالیبراسیون برطرف گردد.\n\n</p>\n<h3>\n\nژیروسکوپ\n\n</h3>\n<p>\n\nهمانطور که می‌دانید، یک ژیروسکوپ به طور اساسی سرعت دورانی به دور یک محور را اندازه‌گیری می‌کند. بدین صورت که چرخش حول یک محور با مقدار مشخصی (به طور غالب در واحد درجه بر ثانیه) اندازه‌گیری شده و چرخش در خلاف جهت آن نتیجه‌ای با علامت عکس تولید می‌کند و در حالتی که چرخش متوقف گردد، مقدار صفر اندازه‌گیری خواهد شد. ژیروسکوپ‌های مکانیکی که اساس کارشان بر پایه‌ی نیروهای کوریولیس یک جرم چرخان استوار است، مدت‌ها در هواپیماها و موشک‌ها به کار گرفته می‌شدند تا آنکه ژیروسکوپ‌های نوری و انواع سامانه‌های میکروالکترومکانیکی ساخته شدند. از میان انواع ساخته شده، ژیروسکوپ‌های نوری دقیق‌ترین و ژیروسکوپ‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی ارزان‌ترین و پرکاربردترین انواع این وسیله‌ی اندازه‌گیری به شمار می‌آیند.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبرخلاف شتاب‌سنح، یک ژیروسکوپ به طور عمومی به لرزش حساس نیست . نتایج اندازه‌گیری یکنواخت‌تری را تولید می‌کند. اما از آنجایی که سرعت دورانی به تنهایی کاربرد چندانی ندارد، و موقعیت زاویه‌ای مدنظر بیشتر ماشین‌های متحرک است، خروجی این حسگر انتگرال‌گیری می‌شود تا موقعیت زاویه‌ای استخراج گردد. وجود انتگرال‌گیر در سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یاب بر پایه‌ی ژیروسکوپ موجب می‌شود کوچک‌ترین آفست‌ها و خطاهای دایمی که وجود آن امری اجتناب ناپذیر است با گذشت زمان روی هم جمع شده و خطای زیادی ایجاد کند. بدین ترتیب موقعیت زاویه‌ای محاسبه شده توسط انتگرال‌گیری از خروجی ژیروسکوپ، به مرور زمان از مقدار واقعی آن دور می‌شود تا جایی که پس از گذشت چند دقیقه (یا حتی چند ثانیه) مقدار محاسبه شده به هیچ عنوان معتبر نیست. این مساله ایجاب می‌کند که ژیروسکوپ‌ها به همراه حسگرهای دیگری مانند حسگرهای تشخیص جهت میدان مغناطیسی زمین و یا شتاب‌سنج به کار گرفته شوند، مگر آنکه هدف از اندازه‌گیری، تنها سرعت دوران باشد و نه موقعیت زاویه‌ای، که بدین ترتیب انتگرال‌گیر حذف شده و خروجی ژیروسکوپ دقت کافی خواهد داشت.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nژیروسکوپ‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی نیز همانند شتاب‌سنج‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی در ابعاد بسیار کوچک و با قیمت مناسب ساخته می‌شوند و حتی بسیاری از سازندگان، دو یا سه ژیروسکوپ که برای اندازه‌گیری در جهت‌های مختلف در راستاهای عمود بر هم قرار گرفته‌اند، را در قالب یک تراشه‌ی الکترونیکی واحد عرضه می‌کنند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: tri_axis_gyroscope)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nیک ژیروسکوپ سه‌محوره سرعت دوران حول سه محور عمود بر هم (ایکس، ایگرگ و زد) را اندازه‌گیری می‌کند. به طور معمول، چرخش راست‌گرد به دور هر محور با علامت مثبت و چرخش چپ‌گرد با علامت منفی مشخص می‌گردد. سرعت دوران اغلب در واحد درجه بر ثانیه بیان می‌شود. در ماشین‌های پرنده مانند موشک و هواپیما و همچنین برخی از ربات‌های متحرک، واژه‌های غلت، سمت‌گشت و تاب برای مشخص کردن محور دوران به کار گرفته می‌شود. محورهای غلت، سمت‌گشت و تاب به طور الزامی منطبق بر محورهای ایکس، ایگرگ و زد نمی‌باشند. و این مساله بستگی به نحوه‌ی تخصیص محورهای مختصات به جسم متحرک دارد.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nهنگام انتخاب ژیروسکوپ باید به محدوده‌ی سرعت قابل اندازه‌گیری آن، سرعت نمونه‌برداری، نحوه‌ی ارتباط با آن (آنالوگ یا دیجیتال)، و همچنین تعداد محورهای لازم با توجه به کاربرد پروژه‌ی خود (یک‌بعدی، دوبعدی، و سه‌بعدی) توجه نمایید. علاوه بر پارامترهای یاد شده، مواردی مانند حساسیت به دما و ولتاژ تغذیه، آفست اولیه (مقدار خوانده شده در حالت سکون) و حساسیت به چرخش در راستاهای دیگر غیر از راستای اندازه‌گیری از جمله نکاتی هستند که باید مورد توجه قرار گیرند. اگر یک ژیروسکوپ حول محوری عمود بر محور اندازه‌گیری دوران داده شود، به طور اصولی باید مقدار صفر را اندازه‌گیری کند. اما در عمل چنین نیست. این مقدار (که باید تا جای ممکن کوچک باشد) بیانگر حساسیت متقابل میان محورها (cross-axis sensitivity) بوده و بر حسب درصد خطا بیان می‌گردد.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<h3>\n\nتلفیق داده‌های خروجی شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ\n\n</h3>\n<p>\n\nدر این بخش قصد داریم برای تشخیص صحیح راستای جاذبه، داده‌های ژیروسکوپ و شتاب‌سنج را با هم مورد استفاده قرار دهیم. یک شتاب‌سنج سه‌محوره به تنهایی می‌تواند برای سنجش جهت‌گیری نسبت به راستای جاذبه به کار گرفته شود. اما این اندازه‌گیری تنها در صورتی صحیح است که هیچ شتاب دیگری غیر از شتاب استاتیک جاذبه به سیستم وارد نشود. این مساله در ربات‌های متحرک امکان‌پذیر نیست. علاوه بر این یک شتاب‌سنج حساسیت زیادی نسبت به لرزش داشته و به دلیل نویز زیاد، اطلاعات خروجی آن به تنهایی ارزش چندانی ندارد. در مقابل، ژیروسکوپ نیز معایب خود را دارد که مهمترین آن دور شدن تدریجی زاویه‌ی محاسبه شده که از انتگرال‌گیری به دست آمده است، از مقدار واقعی است. خوشبختانه خطاهای موجود در اندازه‌گیری ژیروسکوپ و شتاب‌سنج دارای ماهیتی به طور کامل متفاوت می‌باشند، به شکلی که با به کار گرفتن درست هر دو حسگر در کنار هم می‌توان خطاهای خروجی هر دو حسگر را تصحیح کرد. برای استفاده‌ی موثر از داده‌های هر دو حسگر باید اطلاعات خروجی آن‌ها را به نحوی با یکدیگر تلفیق کرد که نتیجه‌ی حاصل شده، از هر کدام از داده‌های حسگرها به تنهایی معتبرتر باشد.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبا فرض آنکه شتاب دینامیک طولانی مدتی به سیستم شما وارد نمی‌شود و بنابراین فرض آنکه راستای جاذبه درست محاسبه شده است، می توانید بردار جاذبه‌ی زمین (که اکنون جهت آن مشخص شده است و مقدار آن نیز برابر با ۹٫۸ متر بر مجذور ثانیه در نظر گرفته شده است) را از بردار شتاب محاسبه شده توسط اطلاعات فیلتر شده شتاب‌سنج تفریق نمایید تا شتاب دینامیک حرکت شما محاسبه شود. با انتگرال‌گیری از شتاب دینامیک می‌توانید سرعت حرکت و موقعیت ربات را به دست آورید. البته این محاسبات به دلیل انتگرال‌گیری تنها در کوتاه‌مدت معتبر می‌باشند. برای جلوگیری از تجمیع خطا در طولانی‌مدت لازم است یک حسگر موقعیت‌یاب دیگر مانند سامانه‌ی موقعیت‌یاب جهانی را به این مجموعه اضافه کنید.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nهمانطور که می‌دانید، در یک سیستم موقعیت‌یاب شامل ژیروسکوپ و شتاب‌سنج سه‌محوره (دارای ۶ درجه‌ی آزادی)، بردار جاذبه که توسط شتاب‌سنج اندازه‌گیری می‌شود همانند معیاری است که از تاثیر ناشی از انحراف تدریجی ژیروسکوپ در تخمین جهت جاذبه ممانعت می‌کند. اما این بردار در صفحه‌ی افق تصویری ندارد. علاوه بر این، با دانستن اندازه و جهت یک بردار شناخته شده (مانند بردار جاذبه) در یک دستگاه مختصات متعامد نمی‌توان راستای قرارگیری هر سه محور آن دستگاه را به طور همزمان مشخص کرد. در واقع نشان داده می‌شود که بیشمار دستگاه مختصات وجود دارد که یک بردار معین را به صورت یکسان اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند (اگر یک دستگاه مختصات را به دور محوری به موازات بردار یاد شده بچرخانید، تمامی دستگاه‌هایی که در اثر چرخش با هر زاویه‌ای حول این محور حاصل می‌شوند بردار نام برده شده را به یک صورت اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند). برای تشخیص دادن نحوه‌ی قرارگیری یک دستگاه مختصات در فضای سه‌بعدی باید نتایج اندازه‌گیری حداقل دو بردار ناموازی را در این دستگاه داشته باشیم. دستگاه مختصاتی که می‌خواهیم جهت‌گیری آن را معلوم کنیم همان واحد موقعیت‌یاب ماست. به همین علت خروجی یک الگوریتم تلفیق داده که از اطلاعات شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ سه‌محوره استفاده می‌کند، برای جهت‌یابی حول محور عمود بر سطح زمین (که همان محور زد می‌باشد) قابل استناد نیست. برای رفع کردن این مشکل لازم است از یک بردار معیار دیگر که در صفحه‌ی افقی تصویر قابل ملاحظه‌ای دارد استفاده شود. یک قطب‌نمای الکترونیکی می‌تواند این هدف را برآورده کند. سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یاب در ماشین‌های پرنده به طور عمومی از هر سه حسگر قطب‌نما، شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ (دارای ۹ درجه‌ی آزادی) بهره می‌گیرند، و الگوریتم تلفیق داده‌ی موجود در آن‌ها، اطلاعات تمامی حسگرها را پردازش می‌کند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: sensor_fusion)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nفشارسنج جهت اندازه‌گیری ارتفاع از سطح دریا به کار گرفته می‌شود که با تلفیق داده‌های آن با شتاب‌سنج (شتاب دینامیک) و ژیروسکوپ، تخمین خوبی از ارتفاع کنونی و سرعت تغییر ارتفاع به دست می‌آید. جهت‌یابی در فضای سه‌بعدی نیز با کمک شتاب‌سنج (شتاب استاتیک)، ژیروسکوپ، و قطب‌نما انجام می‌شود. از میان این حسگرها تنها شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ اساس کارشان بر اینرسی استوار است و واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسی نامیده می‌شود. در حسگرهای بر پایه‌ی اینرسی، نیروهای وارد شده بر یک جرم ثابت یا چرخان اندازه‌گیری می‌شوند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: theproblemsetup)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<h3>\n\nبرآورد شیب با شتاب‌سنج\n\n</h3>\n<p>\n\nدر این بخش، یک برآوردگر برای زاویه‌های تاب و غلت یک جسم صلب به دست می‌آوریم

برآورد شیب\n\n</h2>\n<p>\n\nواحد اندازه‌گیری شتاب‌سنج متر بر مجذور ثانیه می‌باشد و واحد اندازه‌گیری ژیروسکوپ زاویه بر ثانیه می‌باشد. ابتدا با تعریف کردن یک ساختار برنامه‌نویسی داده‌های مورد نیاز الگوریتم را سازمان‌دهی می‌کنیم. یک سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی دارای حداقل یک شتاب‌سنج سه‌محوره و یک ژیروسکوپ سه‌محوره می‌باشد. به کار بردن صفت «سه‌محوره» به ما این پیشنهاد را می‌دهد که به دو بردار سه عنصری نیاز داریم تا داده‌های شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ را در رایانه ذخیره کنیم. اما در واقعیت مقدار مطلق و مقیاس هر عنصر با بقیه عنصرها متفاوت است. به بیانی دیگر یک تبدیل همگرا بر روی هر بردار اندازه‌گیری شده اثر می‌کند که باید در آزمایشگاه فیزیک ضریب‌های آن را با آزمایش کردن بیابیم. در آن صورت می‌توانیم داده‌های حسگرهای مختلف درون یک سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی را با یکدیگر هم‌تراز کنیم و در تلفیق داده‌های چندین سامانه، خطای ناشی از ساختن و نصب کردن حسگرها را کم‌تر کنیم.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبرای جبران کردن مقدار مطلق یک اندازه‌گیری و در نتیجه پیدا کردن نقطه‌ی صفر اندازه‌گیری به سه عدد برای شتاب‌سنج و سه عدد برای ژیروسکوپ نیاز داریم. برای این آزمایش باید بدنه‌ی ربات را به طور تراز بر روی صفحه‌ای صلب که خود نیز نسبت به بردار گرانش زمین تراز است، قرار دهیم. با خواندن مقدارهای خام اندازه‌گیری‌های حسگرها می‌توان یک مقدار جبران کننده از اندازه‌گیری خام کم کرد تا به اندازه‌گیری صفر رسید. این کار را برای هر محور به طور جداگانه انجام می‌دهیم. در مورد ژیروسکوپ‌های باکیفیت ساخت مطلوب، در حالت سکون به طور معمول مقدار جبران‌کننده صفر خواهد بود، در حالی که به خاطر شرایط نصب کردن شتاب‌سنج‌ها مقدار جبران‌کننده به طور تقریبی همیشه غیر صفر است.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبرای پیدا کردن مقیاس یک شتاب‌سنج باید بدانیم که اگر یک محور شتاب‌سنج در راستای بردار گرانش قرار بگیرد، آن‌گاه مقدار مطلق محور خوانده‌شده در حالت سکون باید برابر با یک جی باشد که شتاب استاتیک در ارتفاع سطح دریاهای آزاد است. همین‌طور برای پیدا کردن مقیاس ژیروسکوپ از داده‌های سرعت زاویه‌ای انتگرال می‌گیریم و با چرخاندن بدنه‌ی ربات به اندازه‌ی زاویه‌ای مشخص، ضریب مقیاس را طوری تعیین می‌کنیم که حاصل انتگرال برابر با مقدار درست زاویه شود. تا این مرحله به ۲۴ متغیر نیاز داریم تا تنظیم کردن اندازه‌گیری یک واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی را انجام دهیم. اما به تعداد ۹ متغیر دیگر به تعریف ساختار واحد اضافه می‌کنیم تا نتیجه‌ی پردازش برآورد شیب را در آن‌ها ذخیره کنیم. این ۹ مقدار شامل زاویه‌های اویلر (غلط، تاب و سمت‌گشت) و مشتق‌های مرتبه اول و مرتبه دوم آن‌هاست.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n  int16_t accX_offset;\n  int16_t accY_offset;\n

می‌کند. برای دریافت کردن اندازه‌گیری‌های یک حسگر باید اول به آن یک پیام ارسال کرد و سپس منتظر پاسخ آن حسگر ماند تا مقدارهای اندازه‌گیری شده در قالب یک آرایه در اختیار میکروکنترلر قرار گیرد. هر واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی دارای یک برگه‌ی راهنمای کاربری است که در آن کارخانه‌ی سازنده‌ی حسگر، دستورها، قالب‌های داده، رابط‌ها و تنظیم‌ها را توضیح داده است. برنامه‌نویس با مطالعه کردن برگه‌ی راهنمای کاربری

تا بداند که دریافت اطلاعات تمام شده است. بعد، مقدارهای اندازه‌گیری خام از آرایه‌ی دریافتی خوانده می‌شود و در ساختمان داده‌ی ورودی تابع قرار داده می‌شود. این مقدارها شامل سه محور شتاب‌سنج و سه محور

مستقیم در حافظه میکروکنترلر به وسیله‌ی واحد جانبی سریال آن، ابتدا بررسی می‌شود که آیا حافظه‌ی سریال دارای داده دریافتی تازه‌ای هست یا نه. در صورت به‌روزرسانی حافظه‌ی ورودی واحد سریال میکروکنترلر، قاب داده‌ی دریافتی با آدرس حسگر و سربرگ قاب ارسالی مقایسه می‌شود. در این نوع از ارتباط با میکروکنترلر، فقط یک دفعه، آن هم در ابتدای روشن شدن میکروکنترلر، یک درخواست به واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی فرستاده می‌شود و پس از آن داده‌های دریافتی به طور مرتب و خودکار در حافظه‌ی میکروکنترلر ذخیره می شوند. این کار کمک می‌کند تا در زمان صرفه‌جویی شود. در صورت برابر بودن سربرگ قاب ارسالی با سربرگ قاب دریافتی، میکروکنترلر داده‌های ساختمان را به‌روزرسانی می‌کند: مقدارهای خام شتاب‌سنج سه‌محوره و ژیروسکوپ سه‌محوره. سپس، مقدارهای جبران‌کننده هر محور از مقدارهای خام کم می‌شوند و در مقیاس هر محور به طور جداگانه ضرب می‌شوند. در مورد واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۲ باید بدانیم که به خاطر طراحی صنعتی خاص ربات، حسگر با زاویه‌ی ۳۰ درجه نسبت به محور تقارنی ربات نصب شده است. پس با یک تبدیل چرخشی می‌توان راستای حسگر را با راستای ربات هم‌تراز کرد. البته این کار را می‌توان با استفاده از ماتریس چرخشی حسگر نسبت به بدنه‌ی ربات نیز انجام داد که در ابتدای الگوریتم برآورد شیب تعریف می‌شود. در مقایسه با تابع به‌روزرسانی واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۱، این تابع در هیچ خطی در آن منتظر نمی‌ماند و بسیار سریع و بلادرنگ عمل می‌کند. پس از انجام محاسبه‌ها و به‌روزرسانی ساختمان داده حسگر، پرچم دریافت داده سریال صفر می‌شود و تابع به

بردارهای شناخته‌شده‌ی مساله است که مکان نصب حسگرها بر روی بدنه‌ی صلب را ذخیره می‌کند. اما برای اندازه‌گیری کردن عنصرهای ماتریس پی باید نقطه‌ی چرخش‌گاه ربات مشخص شود، تا به عنوان یک مبدا مکان هر حسگر را نسبت به آن محاسبه کرد. در این طراحی، نقطه‌ی چرخش‌گاه به طور دقیق نقطه‌ای در امتداد محور موتور پایین است به طوری که آن نقطه همچنین مصادف با مرکز چرخ پایین نیز باشد. این انتخاب شاید برای زاویه‌ی تاب ربات ایده‌آل باشد، اما باید بدانیم که چرخش‌گاه زاویه‌ی غلت ربات در واقع بر روی محیط چرخ پایین قرار دارد، جایی که چرخ پایین با زمین برخورد می‌کند. بنابراین انتخاب نقطه‌ی چرخش‌گاه تنها در صورتی دقیق است که از شتاب خطی ربات حداقل در راستای یک محور صرف‌نظر کنیم. خوشبختانه یکی از هدف‌های برآورد شیب به این روش، حذف کردن شتاب‌های خطی در محاسبه‌ی شیب است. پس از اندازه‌گیری مکان هر حسگر در آزمایشگاه فیزیک مجازی، مکان اندازه‌گیری شده نقطه‌ی چرخش‌گاه از مکان اندازه‌گیری هر حسگر به طور جداگانه کم می‌شود تا مبدا همه‌ی مکان‌ها، نقطه‌ی چرخش‌گاه ربات باشد. ماتریس پی یک ماتریس حقیقی با ابعاد ۴ در ال می‌باشد که

استفاده از ماتریس پی محاسبه می‌شود: ترانهاده‌ی ماتریس پی ضرب در معکوس حاصل‌ضرب ماتریس پی در ترانهاده‌ی خودش. اگر فقط یک حسگر داسته باشیم، آن‌گاه متغیر ال برابر با یک خواهد بود و در نتیجه ماتریس پی یک بردار می‌شود. مشکل استفاده از تنها یک حسگر این است که حاصل‌ضرب ماتریس پی در ترانهاده‌ی خودش ماتریسی خواهد بود که معکوس آن تعریف‌شده نیست. پس، استفاده کردن از حداقل ۲ حسگر به خاطر قوانین جبر خطی الزامی

اینرسیایی عمومی، یک اشاره‌گر مدل سامانگر خطی درجه دوم به عنوان ورودی دریافت می‌شود. وظیفه‌ی این تابع، ابتدا به‌روزرسانی اندازه‌گیری‌های دو واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی است که به طور متوالی انجام می‌شود، و سپس برآورد شیب و تلفیق داده حسگرهاست. با صدا زدن دو تابع به‌روزرسانی واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۱ و ۲ قسمت اول وظیفه انجام می‌شود. در فرض مساله‌ی برآورد شیب مهم است که تا حد امکان به طور تقریبی این اندازه‌گیری‌ها به طور همزمان انجام شوند. اما برای برآورد شیب، بردارهای آر ۱ و آر ۲ را با استفاده از اندازه‌گیری شتاب‌سنج ساختمان‌های داده واحدهای ۱ و ۲ مقداردهی می‌کنیم. به دلیل اینکه چهارچوب مختصات حسگرها نسبت به چهارچوب بدنه‌ی ربات چرخشی ندارند، بردارهای آر در ماتریس همانی (ماتریس بی) ضرب می‌شوند و بدون تغییر به مرحله‌ی بعدی برآورد راه پیدا می‌کنند. اما طراحی الگوریتم اجازه می‌دهد تا هر واحد حسگر را به طور دلخواه در طراحی ربات نصب کرد و با مقداردهی درست ماتریس بی برای هر واحد، بردار آر آن واحد را به شکل جداگانه و مناسب چرخاند تا جزییات طراحی ربات به مرحله‌ی بعدی برآورد شیب راه پیدا نکند. در ادامه، ماتریس ام از عنصرهای بردار آر برای حسگر ۱ و بردار آر برای حسگر ۲ به صورت دو بلوک ستونی مقداردهی می‌شود. بعد ماتریس ام در ماتریس تلفیق بهینه ضرب می‌شود تا ماتریس مجهول کیو به دست آید. ضرب کردن ماتریس ام در ماتریس ایکس مهم‌ترین گام الگوریتم برآورد شیب است. زیرا که بردار گرانش را از ستون اول ماتریس کیو می‌خوانیم و سپس با تابع معکوس تانژانت زاویه‌های غلت و تاب (به ترتیب بتا و گاما) را محاسبه می‌کنیم.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر آخرین مرحله، داده‌های ژیروسکوپ و شتاب‌سنج را با یکدیگر تلفیق می‌کنیم تا اثر نویز را بر برآورد موقعیت بدنه کاهش دهیم. به منظور تلفیق داده‌های شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ، ابتدا سرعت‌های زاویه‌ای هر ژیروسکوپ (که بردار سه عنصری می‌باشد) را با استفاده از ماتریس بی می‌چرخانیم تا از مختصات حسگر به مختصات بدنه چرخانده شوند. سپس، سرعت‌های زاویه‌ای واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۱ را با سرعت‌های زاویه‌ای واحد ۲ جمع می‌کنیم و نتیجه را بر ۲ تقسیم می‌کنیم تا به میانگین هر دو واحد برسیم. بعد، ماتریس ای را تشکیل می‌دهیم که در واقع یک تابعک وابسته به زاویه‌های غلت و تاب (بتا و گاما) می‌باشد. با ضرب ماتریس-بردار ماتریس ای در بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای به بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای درست دست پیدا می‌کنیم. ضرب ماتریس-بردار ماتریس ای در بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی گام مهمی در تلفیق داده است، زیرا بسته به زاویه‌های غلت و تاب برآورده شده‌ی شتاب‌سنجی، بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی به بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای اویلری تبدیل می‌شود. با اندازه‌گیری کردن دوره‌ی به‌روزرسانی حسگرها بر حسب ثانیه، می‌توانیم اختلاف زمانی دوره را در سرعت زاویه‌ای ضرب کنیم (که ضرب عدد ثابت در تک تک عنصرهای یک بردار می‌باشد) تا به بردار زاویه مطلق برسیم.\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر پایان، یک ترکیب خطی از مقدار انتگرال‌گیری شده سرعت‌زاویه‌ای و مقدار برآورد شیب شتاب‌سنجی را به عنوان مقدار تلفیق داده شده محاسبه می‌کنیم تا به برآورد شیب کلی بهتری برسیم. این ترکیب خطی با ثابت‌های کاپا ۱ و کاپا ۲ تعیین می‌شود، به طوری که برآورد شیبی که تنها با استفاده از شتاب‌سنج به دست آمده است با برآورد شیبی که با مجموع انتگرال سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی و برآورد شیب شتاب‌سنجی در گام زمانی پیشین به دست آمده است، ترکیب می‌شود. نسبت این ترکیب خطی به گونه‌ای است که عمده‌ی برآورد شیب تلفیقی بر عهده‌ی شتاب‌سنج باشد، زیرا عمل انتگرال‌گیری از سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی خطای اندازه‌گیری را انباشته می‌کند و بنابراین با تعیین کردن مناسب ضریب‌های ترکیب کاپا ۱ و ۲، این انباشتگی خطا را در طول زمان محدود می‌کنیم. محاسبه کردن مشتق‌های مرتبه اول و مرتبه دوم زاویه‌های غلت و تاب با یک تفریق ساده انجام می‌شود و در نهایت در ساختمان داده‌ی واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۱ ذخیره می شود تا مدل سامانگر خطی درجه دوم از آن برای کنترل موقعیت ربات استفاده کند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<h2>\n\nمدل‌سازی و استخراج رابطه‌های ریاضی حاکم بر

باشد (یا دارای تعادل ناپایدار باشد) و توسط یک سیستم کنترلی به تعادل دست پیدا کند، پاندول معکوس گفته می‌شود. پاندول‌های معکوس سال‌ها مورد توجه آزمایشگاه‌های کنترل و سیستم بوده‌اند، چراکه ماهیت نامتعادل و غیرخطی آن‌ها امکان بررسی میزان موثر بودن الگوریتم‌های کنترلی را فراهم می‌کند. ساختارهای مشابه با این نیز در طبیعت یافت می‌شوند، از جمله راه رفتن انسان. با توجه به آنکه مقطع کف پای انسان چندان بزرگ نیست، بدن انسان به خودی خود تعادل زیادی ندارد و آنچه موجب حفظ تعادل در هنگام راه رفتن، دویدن، یا حتی ایستادن می‌شود، فرمان‌های کنترلی است که از مغز به ماهیچه‌ها ارسال می‌گردد. \n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nبرای مدل‌سازی و انجام دادن محاسبات دینامیکی لازم است وزن و محل مرکز ثقل ربات را بدانید. همچنین دانستن ممان اینرسی دورانی مجموعه‌ی چرخ و موتور، و ممان اینرسی دورانی بدنه‌ی ربات حول محور افقی عبور کننده از مرکز ثقل، و پارامترهای موتور برای انجام محاسبات تکمیلی ضروری است. پیدا کردن محل مرکز ثقل ربات ساخته‌شده آسان است. با توجه به آنکه ساختار ربات تقارن طولی/عرضی دارد، نقطه‌ی مرکز ثقل بر روی خط طولی/عرضی میانی ربات خواهد بود. حال برای مشخص شدن موقعیت دقیق آن کافی است ربات را به صورت عمودی بر روی یک شکل گوه مانند قرار دهید (شبیه الاکلنگ) و سعی کنید ربات به صورت متعادل قرار گیرد. حال برای انجام دادن محاسبات بعدی می‌توانید تمامی وزن ربات را روی مرکز ثقل آن که در فاصله‌ی مشخصی از محور چرخ اصلی و سطح زمین قرار دارد، در نظر بگیرید.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir =

می‌آید، در نظر گرفته شده است. البته می‌توانید با ساخت مدل چرخ در نرم‌افزارهای طراحی مکانیکی مانند کتیا و یا از طریق انجام دادن آزمایش مقدار دقیق آن را محاسبه کنید.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر مدل‌سازی یک ربات تعادلی، اغلب گشتاور موتورها به نحوی در معادلات توصیف کننده‌ی حرکت ربات دخالت داده می‌شود و نه سرعت آن‌ها. در واقع توصیف کردن تعادل ربات و تهیه کردن یک تابع تبدیل یا مدل فضای حالت بر اساس سرعت موتور پیچیدگی خاصی دارد. به همین علت بیشتر سازندگان از موتورهای جریان مستقیم در ربات‌های تعادلی خود استفاده می‌کنند تا مدل‌سازی ریاضی آن به سادگی امکان‌پذیر باشد. علاوه بر این، موتورهای جریان مستقیم به طور معمول توان بالاتری نسبت به موتورهای پله‌ای با ابعاد و وزن مشابه دارند.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبا توجه به ابعاد کوچک و وزن کم روتور، ممان اینرسی آن بسیار کمتر از چرخ است. اما به علت وجود گیربکس، روتور سرعت بسیار بالاتری نسبت به چرخ دارد. در نتیجه، ممان اینرسی روتور در نسبت تبدیل گیربکس ضرب می‌شود تا ممان اینرسی موثر روتور که از بیرون گیربکس اندازه‌گیری می‌شود، به دست آید. این مقدار به طور معمول قابل صرف‌نظر کردن نیست. اما برای محاسبه کردن تاثیر آن در حرکت ربات باید موافق یا مخالف بودن جهت چرخش روتور نسبت به چرخ را بدانید (به علت وجود گیربکس، جهت چرخش به طور الزامی یکسان نیست). در هر حال، از این ممان اینرسی در اینجا صرف‌نظر شده است. اما برای بالا بردن دقت محاسبات می‌توانید تاثیر آن را وارد کنید. مقدار ممان اینرسی روتور و اجزاء داخلی گیربکس به طور معمول در برگه‌ی مشخصات موتور و گیربکس ذکر می‌شود و البته از طریق آزمایش نیز قابل محاسبه است. در اینجا از ممان اینرسی دورانی مجموعه‌ی روتور و گیربکس صرف‌نظر کردیم. برای محاسبه ی ممان اینرسی دورانی ربات، یک مدل بسیار ساده از بدنه و موتورها که بیانگر محل قرارگیری جرم‌های هر جزء باشد، در نظر می‌گیریم.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nبعضی از طراحان، ربات را در نرم‌افزارهای شبیه‌سازی مکانیک مانند مدولیکا / دایمولا یا سیمولینک / سیم‌مکانیکس شبیه‌سازی می‌کنند و با توجه به رفتار ربات بر اساس سرعت موتور، یک معادله‌ی ریاضی برای آن در نظر می‌گیرند. محاسباتی که برای به دست آوردن مدل ریاضی ربات‌های تعادلی انجام می‌شود، به طور عمومی بر پایه‌ی یکی از دو روش لاگرانژ انرژی یا تحلیل نیروهای نیوتنی استوار است. در مدل پاندول معکوس که توسط یک لولا به یک سیستم متحرک اتصال دارد، گشتاور داخلی میان ربات و چرخ آن تاثیر چندانی بر روی حرکت ربات ندارد. این حالت وقتی ایجاد می‌شود که ممان اینرسی دورانی چرخ در برابر ربات ناچیز باشد. \n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: balance_robot_inverted_pendulum_on_cart)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<h4>\n\nمقایسه‌ی

ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۱ وظیفه‌ی رساندن ربات به موقعیت مطلوب ایکس پایین‌نویس دی را برعهده دارد. ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۲ که بر روی سرعت ربات تاثیر می‌گذارد، نقش ترمز داشته و از اضافه شدن بی‌رویه‌ی سرعت ربات جلوگیری می‌کند. ضریب‌های کا پایین‌نویس ۳ و کا پایین‌نویس ۴ سعی دارند انحراف ربات و سپس نرخ تغییرات این انحراف را به صفر برسانند. هر یک از اجزاء رابطه‌ی بالا به نحوی با تغییر شتاب خطی سیستم محرکه سعی دارند که حالت متعادل را در ربات برقرار کنند. با توجه به این رابطه، حالت متعادل به معنای قرار گرفتن ربات در مکان مشخص ایکس پایین‌نویس دی و سرعت صفر در این مکان و ایجاد تعادل عمودی در آن است. بدین ترتیب کنترلر ساده تشریح شده که در حقیقت عملکردی مشابه با یک کنترلر حالت دارد، هم زاویه‌ی انحراف ربات و هم موقعیت آن را تحت کنترل می‌گیرد.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر رابطه ی بالا، تمامی ضریب‌ها مقدارهای مثبت دارند. بدین ترتیب هنگامی که ربات به سمت جلو منحرف شده است، چرخ‌ها با حرکت شتاب‌دار (شتاب مثبت) به سمت جلو حرکت می‌کنند تا دوباره ربات به حالت متعادل و صاف برگردد (مقدار مثبت برای ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۳). همین مساله در مورد چرخش بدنه ربات به سمت جلو صادق است. به عنوان مثال، ممکن است بدنه‌ی ربات مقدار اندکی به سمت عقب متمایل شده باشد. اما در همین وضعیت، با سرعت زیاد در حال دوران به سمت جلو باشد. این یعنی اگرچه اکنون ربات به سمت عقب متمایل است، اما به زودی تغییر جهت داده و به سمت جلو کج می‌شود. این وضعیت در مواقعی که یک نیروی خارجی به صورت ناگهانی ربات را به سمت جلو هل می‌دهد، اتفاق می‌افتد. بنابراین ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۴ نیز باید مقداری مثبت باشد تا هرگاه ربات در حال دوران به سمت جلو بود، چرخ‌های آن با حرکت شتاب‌دار به جلو حرکت کرده و پیشاپیش از منحرف شدن ربات به سمت جلو پیشگیری کنند.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر مورد پارامترهای کا پایین‌نویس ۱ و کا پایین‌نویس ۲ وضعیت اندکی متفاوت است. این بخش از کنترلر سعی در رساندن موقعیت ربات به مکان مطلوب و جلوگیری از افزایش سرعت بی‌رویه‌ی آن دارد. با این توصیف به نظر می‌آید که ضریب‌های کا پایین‌نویس ۱ و کا پایین‌نویس ۲ باید مقدار منفی داشته باشند. اما در حقیقت این دو پارامتر نیز مثبت هستند. با دو مثال ساده این مساله را توجیه می‌کنیم. فرض کنید ربات با سرعت زیادی به سمت جلو در حال حرکت است. اکنون برای آنکه سرعت خود را کم کند، اگر ناگهان ترمز بگیرد به سمت جلو سقوط خواهد کرد. بنابراین در این وضعیت باید ابتدا با حرکت شتاب‌دار چرخ‌ها را به سمت جلو حرکت دهد تا بدنه‌ی ربات به سمت عقب متمایل شود. سپس با کمک این انحراف به عقب، می‌تواند سرعت خود را به تدریج کاهش دهد، بدون آنکه ترمز گرفتن موجب سقوط آن شود. حال فرض کنید ربات در مکان ایکس ایستاده است و می‌خواهیم به جلو حرکت کرده و به موقعیت ایکس پایین‌نویس دی برود. واضح است که در این وضعیت، عبارت تفاضل ایکس و ایکس پایین‌نویس دی مقدار منفی دارد. اکنون ربات برای حرکت به جلو مجبور است ابتدا خود را به سمت جلو خم کند و سپس به حرکت درآید. برای متمایل شدن ربات به جلو باید لحظاتی چرخ‌های آن به سمت عقب حرکت کنند (شتاب منفی). بنابر این شتاب حرکت ربات با عبارت تفاضل ایکس و ایکس پایین‌نویس دی هم‌علامت است. پس ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۱ باید مقدار مثبت داشته باشد. پس از آنکه ربات به سمت جلو متمایل شد، ضریب‌های کا پایین‌نویس ۳ و کا پایین‌نویس ۴ به طور همزمان وارد عمل شده و ربات را با حرکت شتاب‌دار (شتاب مثبت) به جلو (به سمت مکان ایکس پایین‌نویس دی) حرکت می‌دهند. در حقیقت، عملکرد کنترلر با فعالیت همزمان چهار جزء آن که بر روی چهار پارامتر مختلف ربات (موقعیت، سرعت، زاویه و سرعت زاویه‌ای) نظارت دارند، انجام می‌شود.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nبرای انتخاب بدنه‌ی ربات باید چند نکته را رعایت کنید تا ایجاد پایداری در آن خیلی دشوار نباشد. در یک پاندول معکوس، اگر مرکز ثقل پاندول از محور دوران فاصله‌ی خیلی کمی داشته باشد (پاندول کوتاه) کنترل تعادل دشوار خواهد بود. اما در یک بالانس‌ربات به طور لزوم چنین نیست. تفاوت این دو از نحوه‌ی تاثیر نیروی موتور در بازیابی تعادل نشات می‌گیرد. در پاندول معکوس نیروی موتور موجب به حرکت در آمدن پایه‌ی پاندول شده و به طور غیر مستقیم روی پاندول تاثیر می‌گذارد، چرا که اتصال مکانیکی میان پاندول و واگن به طور صرف یک لولای ساده است. در مقابل، در بالانس‌ربات، نیروی موتور نه تنها از طریق به حرکت در آوردن ربات بر روی تعادل آن تاثیر می‌گذارد، بلکه گشتاور داخلی (متقابل) میان موتور و چرخ نیز به بازیابی تعادل کمک می‌کند، و این به خاطر ممان اینرسی دورانی چرخ است. به عنوان مثال، فرض کنید چرخ‌های ربات به زمین چسبیده‌اند (معادل ممان اینرسی بینهایت برای چرخ‌ها). در این صورت گشتاوری که موتور به چرخ اعمال می‌کند، به طور مستقیم موجب چرخیدن بدنه ی موتور و ربات می‌شود، بدون آنکه حرکت خطی اتفاق افتاده باشد. ممکن است ربات‌های تعادلی خیلی کوچکی دیده باشید که اندازه‌ی چرخ آن در مقایسه با ابعاد ربات قابل توجه باشد. کنترل تعادل یک چنین رباتی بسیار ساده است. البته این ربات توانایی حرکت سریع و قدرت مانور چندانی نخواهد داشت.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nبرای کنترل صحیح ربات لازم است رفتار دینامیکی آن را بشناسیم. به این منظور یک مدل ریاضی از آن تهیه می‌کنیم، که عملکرد ربات‌مان را بر اساس ورودی اعمال شده (ولتاژ تغذیه‌ی موتور) توصیف نماید. ابتدا رابطه‌های ریاضی حاکم بر موتور جریان مستقیم را مورد بررسی قرار می‌دهیم. از میان معادلات مختلفی که برای گشتاور، سرعت، جریان، و ولتاژ تغذیه‌ی یک موتور جریان مستقیم نوشته می‌شود، تنها آن‌هایی که در مدل‌سازی ربات تعادلی به کار می‌آید را مطرح می‌کنیم. در یک موتور جریان مستقیم خطی،

داریم. به دلیل منابع سخت‌افزاری محدود میکروکنترلرها، اختصاص دادن آرایه‌های بزرگ دو بعدی در حافظه‌ی میکروکنترلر مشکل است. بنابراین در ساختار داده‌ی ماتریس‌های صافی و خودهمبستگی معکوس هر سطر به طور جداگانه یک میدان به خود اختصاص می‌دهد تا شکسته شدن داده در حافظه امکان‌پذیر باشد بدون اینکه دسترسی به ماتریس‌ها سخت شود. دو تابع «نسبت دادن اندیس» و «دریافت اندیس» به منظور دسترسی به عنصرهای ماتریس تعریف شده اند. آرگومان‌های تابع دریافت اندیس شامل یک نسخه از ساختمان داده و دو اندیس سطر و ستون است. خروجی تابع دریافت اندیس یک عدد ممیز شناور است که مقدار درایه‌ی ماتریس را با توجه به اندیس‌های داده شده بر می‌گرداند. در حالی که آرگومان‌های تابع نسبت دادن اندیس شامل یک اشاره‌گر به نسخه‌ی اصلی ماتریس در حافظه است، و علاوه بر اندیس‌های سطر و ستون، با مقداری که به درایه‌ی مورد نظر باید نسبت داده شود نیز همراه است. به این ترتیب با دو تابع دسترسی به ماتریس که تعریف کردیم، عملیات به‌روزرسانی ماتریس‌های صافی و خودهمبستگی معکوس رابطی برنامه‌نویسی مشابه با آرایه‌های دو بعدی زبان برنامه‌نویسی سی پیدا می‌کنند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nfloat getIndex(Mat12 matrix, int i, int j)\n\nvoid setIndex(Mat12 *matrix, int i, int j, float value)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nوضعیت ربات پس از یک یا چند بار اجرا شدن

ابتدای حلقه‌ی تابع اصلی برنامه، مقدار فیوز بیت ۱ خوانده می‌شود تا بتوان به منظور تنظیم کردن واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی به طور موقت کنترلر را غیر فعال کرد. غیر فعال کردن فیوز بیت ۱ باعث می‌شود تا موتورها خاموش شوند و از لرزش ناخواسته هنگام محاسبه کردن مقدارهای جبران کننده‌ی شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ جلوگیری کرد. سپس، شرط ایمنی بررسی می‌شود، که قدر مطلق زاویه‌های غلت و تاب را با ثابت‌های از پیش تعریف شده مقایسه می‌کند تا بتواند سقوط ربات را تشخیص دهد و مدل کنترلر را غیر فعال کند. همچنین گام زمانی کا در سامانگر خطی درجه دوم بررسی می‌شود تا از اجرای بی‌نهایت برنامه در طول زمان جلوگیری شود. وقتی که پرچم کنترلر ربات غیر فعال باشد، با فشردن کلید آبی رنگ بر روی برد نوکلیو-۶۴ می‌توان کنترلر را دوباره فعال کرد. چراغ سبز رنگ برنامه متناسب با فعال بودن یا غیرفعال بودن کنترلر ربات روشن و خاموش می‌شود. به صورتی که هنگام فعال بودن پرچم چراغ خاموش می‌شود و برای مثال به محض سقوط ربات چراغ سبز روشن می‌شود تا به کاربر بفهماند که کنترلر غیر فعال است.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nاگر پرچم پایان برنامه غیرفعال باشد، تابع گام برداشتن به جلو فراخوانی می‌شود. در غیر این صورت، چرخه‌ی کاری مدولاسیون پهنای باند هر دو موتور صفر می‌شود و تنها مقدار اندازه‌گیری حسگرها به‌روزرسانی می شود. این کار کمک می‌کند تا بدون حرکت ربات بتوان حسگرها را تنظیم کرد و عیب‌یابی کرد. اما اگر که پرچم پایان برنامه فعال باشد و به طور همزمان پرچم به‌روزرسانی برنامه غیرفعال باشد، آن‌گاه تابع به‌روزرسانی تدبیرگر پسخوردی فراخوانی می‌شود. تابع به‌روزرسانی تدبیرگر پس از پایان اجرا شدن، پرچم به‌روزرسانی تدبیرگر را فعال می‌کند تا از به‌روزرسانی مدل در چرخه‌های متوالی جلوگیری شود. در صورتی که گام زمانی کا در سامانگر خطی درجه دوم ضریبی از عدد ۱۰۰ باشد، تابع به‌روزرسانی تدبیرگر پسخوردی فراخوانی می‌شود که روش اصلی به‌روزرسانی تدبیرگر است.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nwhile (1)\n{\n  t1 = DWT->CYCCNT;\n\n  if (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_0) ==

ال۲۹۳دی دارای چهار مدار نیم‌پل ایچ با جریان بالاست. مدار مجتمع ال۲۹۳دی می‌تواند جریان‌های الکتریکی را به صورت دوطرفه با حداکثر جریان ۶۰۰ میلی آمپر در بازه ی ولتاژ ۴٫۵ ولت تا ۳۶ ولت بگرداند. این قطعه برای رانش بارهای القایی مانند سیم‌پیچ موتورها مناسب است. دمای کاری این آی‌سی از صفر تا ۷۰ درجه‌ی سانتیگراد است. در کاربرد ربات تعادلی تک‌چرخ، از آی‌سی ال۲۹۳دی به عنوان دو مدار پل ایچ مستقل استفاده شده است. به طوری که ورودی فعال‌کننده‌ی هر پل با مدولاسیون پهنای پالس کنترل می‌شود تا سرعت هر موتور به طور جداگانه کنترل شود. پس، دو ورودی یک پل ایچ برای کنترل جهت چرخش موتور به کار می‌روند. به این شکل که با صفر کردن یک ورودی و یک کردن ورودی دیگر موتور ربات با سرعتی که به چرخه‌ی کاری مدولاسیون پهنای پالس بستگی دارد شروع به چرخش می‌کند، و با معکوس کردن منطقی دو ورودی پل ایچ، جهت چرخش موتور عوض می‌شود. این کار کمک می‌کند تا از تنها ۲ پالس برای کنترل سرعت موتورها استفاده شود که در واقع متناظر با همان دو ورودی سامانگر خطی درجه دوم هستند. برای جلوگیری از حرکت‌های احتمالی بیش از حد سریع و ناخواسته‌ی موتورها، ابتدا ورودی سامانگر خطی درجه دوم انتگرال گیری می‌شود و سپس مقدار نتیجه‌ی انتگرال با تغییر مقیاسی مناسب به چرخه‌ی کاری مدولاسیون پهنای پالس موتور تبدیل می‌شود.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image:

تا تغذیه‌ی مدارهای منطقی ربات را تامین کنند. مدارهایی که با ولتاژ ۵ ولت جریان مستقیم کار می‌کنند: حسگرهای اثر هال رمزنگار چرخ عکس‌العملی و حسگرهای جریان موتورها، حسگرهای ترانزیستور نوری رمزنگار چرخ

گشتاور را گسترش دهیم تا احتمال رسیدن چرخ عکس‌العملی به حالت اشباع را کاهش دهیم. مدار مجتمع ال۲۹۳دی دارای دو ورودی تغذیه‌ی مجزا است: ورودی وسطح ولتاژ منطقی در پایه‌ی ۱۶ قطعه و ورودی سطح ولتاژ قدرت در پایه‌ی ۸ قطعه. چون سرعت چرخش موتور جریان مستقیم با ولتاژ ورودی رابطه‌ی مستقیمی دارد، ولتاژ خط تغذیه‌ی قدرت مدار باید به ۱۲ ولت جریان مستقیم نزدیک‌تر شود. بنابراین پایه‌ی ۸ آی‌سی گرداننده‌ی ال۲۹۳دی به

تعادل خود را حفظ کند. محدود کردن اندازه‌ی گشتاور تولید شده با عکس‌العمل سریع نیز به نوبت خود احتمال به اشباع رسیدن چرخ عکس‌العملی را کمتر می‌کند. پس برای جلوگیری از افت ناگهانی ولتاژ خط تغذیه‌ی ۷٫۴ ولتی، از هفت خازن با ظرفیتی در حدود ۴۷۰ میکرو فاراد استفاده شده است. این خازن‌ها به طور موازی به یکدیگر وصل شده اند. ذخیره کردن انرژی الکتریکی در خازن‌ها کمک می‌کند تا سامانگر خطی درجه دوم بتواند افت ولتاژ ورودی (ناشی از تغییر جهت دادن ناگهانی موتورها) را بلافاصله جبران کند و به طور موثر در دنیای فیزیکی عمل کند. بانک خازن در زمان افت ولتاژ شدید (بارهای الکتریکی سنگین و گذرا) تخلیه می شود و با گرفتن ضربه، ولتاژ تغذیه را ثابت و پیوسته نگه می‌دارد.\n\n</p>\n</div>","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle_persian.html#References","page":"The Unicycle

The diffeomorphism group Diff(M) of spacetime M plays a comparable role in general relativity. In the case of Minkowski spacetime, rotations correspond to Lorentz transformations.\n\nTransformations\n\nAn active Poincaré transformation sends the world vector U at point O to a world vector V at point hatO. If the transformation also sends the the tetrad at O to a tetrad at hatO, then the coordinates of U are the same as those of V.\n\n(Image: 4)\n\nY Negative\n\nThe abstract sphere mathcaly^- of past null directions represents the observer's celectial sphere in a natural way. The sphere S^-, or its projection to sphere S, gives a more concrete but less invariant realization.\n\n(Image: 5)\n\nStereographic Projection\n\nThe stereographic peojection sends points from the sphere S^+ into the Argand plane. For that purpose, choose the North Pole as a point from which the map projects all other points in the sphere. Then, the union of the plane and the point at infinity yields the Riemann sphere.\n\n(Image: 6)\n\nSpherical Coordinates\n\nLight rays reaching the eyes of an observer pierce a sphere centered at the observer's position. Specify a point in the celectial sphere with a latitude and a longitude. The geometry of the equation zeta = e^i phi cot(theta  2) relates the spherical polar angles theta and phi to the complex stereographic coordinate zeta.\n\n(Image: 7)\n\nStereographic Projection\n\nIn Minkowski space-time, the intersection of the null cone with a plane yields a sphere. As the plane through curve segment ON varies, it provides the stereographic projection. The point P maps to point P^prime. The parabolic intersection of the sectional plane with the cone has the same intrinsic Euclidean metric as the Argand plane.\n\n(Image: 8)\n\nFour-Screw\n\nA Lorentz transformations in Minkowski space-time chooses an inertial frame for an observer. The properties of Lorentz transformations are best shown on the Riemann sphere, because it has all the null directions of an observer. A proper rotation and a boost in the z direction combine together to make a four-screw.\n\n(Image: 9)\n\nNull Rotation\n\nA null rotation is a type of Lorentz transformation where a single point is left as the only fixed point. The rigid transformation of the Argand plane projects to a transformation on the Riemann sphere. For the Riemann sphere, the points are displaced along circles through the south pole tangent to the y-direction there.\n\n(Image: 10)\n\nNull Flag\n\nA null cone is in the tangent space of spacetime at point O. The representation of a spin-vector requires a pair of infinitesimally separated points on mathcaly^+. A spin-vector is shown in terms of points P and P^prime of a null flag.\n\n(Image: 11)\n\nCross-Sections\n\nThe curve segment connecting point O to point N represents the temporal direction. The temporal direction is normal to a cross-section of the null cone. The angle between the temporal direction of the two sections determines a metric. which measures lengths and angles. After a transformation in the linear space of the generators of the cone, the sides of triangles are multiplied by a scalar number.\n\n(Image: 12)\n\nSO(3)\n\nConstruct a complicated object by annihilating and creating boundaries.

Even though both copies of SO(3) represent the same 3D orientation, they are distinguished from each other as points in the special unitary group of complex dimension two SU(2).\n\nThe equivalence class of twisted frames at boundary points defines a group of rotations SO(3). The clutching construction makes an associated vector bundle with the 3-dimensional sphere S^3. The construction creates a vector bundle through a continuous function denoted by f. The clutching function resolves the conflicts of tangent frames along the boundary. It does so by producing an image elements in SO(3) given an element in the boundary where the two copies of S^3 meet.\n\n(Image: 13)\n\nDirac's scissors problem\n\nA line passing through the North Pole intersects a section at point P and makes a corresponding intersection on the other section. For showing the metric structure of the sections, choose three points close to each other, such that they make similar triangles in each section. Dirac’s scissors problem shows that a continuous rotation of the structure through 2pi changes the sign of the half plane that is attached to it.\n\n(Image: 14)\n\nSpin structure: one-to-two relation between O^uparrow_+(13) and SL(2mathbbC)\n\nThis is a one-to-two relation between a restricted Lorentz transformation and the special linear group of complex dimension two, up to a boost. The topology of the relation is like the one-to-two relation between the special orthogonal group of real dimension three and the special unitary group of complex dimension two. The geometric structure of similar triangles with vertices: P, P^prime and P^primeprime, undergoes unrestricted spin transformations.\n\n(Image: 15)\n\nA null flag bundle\n\nThe null-flag bundle F of M, and its twofold covering space, the spin-vector bundle F^prime are shown. The bundle projection map sends a null-flag to an event in space-time M. Null-flags in the fiber space are 4-dimensional, making the total space of the null-flag bundle 8-dimensional.\n\n(Image: 16)\n\nA unique frame ABCD\n\nThe map to mathbbR^4, of future null cone and null flag, provides, in continuous fashion, a unique frame ABCD. The following 8 steps construct a unique frame that is right-handed and orthonormal with respect to the Euclidean metric of mathbbR^4.\n\nGenerate a spin-vector with two complex numbers and a time sign.\nUse vector sum and the antipode of the spin-vector to find the timelike vector inside the future null cone.\nGenerate another spin-vector off of the first spin-vector such that the two spin-vectors make a null flag.\nNormalize the sum of the flagpole of the original spin-vector and the flagpole of its antipode to give vector A in Minkowski vector space.\nCalculate the axis B by projecting the flagpole to the orthogonal complement hyperplane that has A as its normal vector.\nCalculate axis C by summing the spin-vector that is infinitesimally close to the original spin-vector with the negative of the original spin-vector.\nProject the result onto the orthogonal hyperplane where A is the normal vector.\nFind axis D by subtracting every partial component that is along A, B or C, from a random vector.\n\n(Image: 17)\n\nA spin-frame\n\nWhat is the relation between a spin-frame and a Minkowski tetrad? A spin-frame is in a vector space over complex numbers. The spin space has the axioms of an abstract vector space. If a spin-vector is in S^-, then under restricted spin-transformations it does not leave the sphere S^- to S^+.\n\n(Image: 18)\n\nSpin-vectors in terms of S^+\n\nA spin-vector is a ratio between a pair of complex numbers, along with a time sign. Spin-vectors exist in a spin-space that is equipped with three operations: scalar multiplication, inner product and addition. Unless an unrestricted Lorentz transformation is applied, spin-vectors remain in either the sphere of past null directions S^- or S^+.\n\n(Image: 19)\n\nSum of angles\n\nIn the sphere of future null directions S^+, a circle connects three points: the north pole N, point P and point Q. At point P a tangent vector is denoted by L. Also, at point Q a tangent vector is denoted by M. Any circle on S^+ through points P and Q makes the same sum-of-angles with arrows L and M.\n\n(Image: 20)\n\nArgument of the inner product\n\nThe inner product of two spin-vectors omega and kappa is a complex number. When they are combined in a linear fashion, the flagpoles of omega and kappa span a 2-plane. Perform these 4 steps in order to calculate the argument of the scalar product.\n\nUse the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method to find the orthogonal complement of the 2-plane.\nFind the intersection of the flagplanes of kappa and omega with the orthogonal complement 2-plane from the previous step.\nThe flagplane of kappa intersects along the line U, whereas the flagplane of omega intersects along the line V.\nFind the angle between U and V to measure the argument of the inner product: pi + 2 argkappa omega (mod 2pi).\n\n(Image: 21)\n\nSum of spin-vectors in terms of S^+\n\nThe addition of spin-vectors kappa and omega results in another spin-vector kappa + omega in the spin-space. The tails of the flagpoles of kappa, omega and kappa + omega are in a circle. The circumcircle of the triangle made by joining the the three spin-vectors makes the same angle with each one of the flagpoles.\n\n(Image: 22)\n\nSum of spin-vectors in terms of the Argand plane\n\nThis shows the sum of spin-vectors in a special Lorentz frame that brings out the symmetry at a spacetime event. In this inertial frame, we have three mappings in a circular fashion: kappa mapsto -omega, omega mapsto kappa + omega, and kappa + omega mapsto kappa. This way, the flagpole pair and their sum are collinear in the Argand plane.\n\n(Image: 23)\n\nA special frame that brings out the symmetry of spin-vector sum\n\nThis special frame brings out the symmetry of spin-vector sum. In this inertial frame, we have four mappings in a circular fashion:\n\nkappa mapsto frac1sqrt2 (kappa - omega)\nfrac1sqrt2 (kappa - omega) mapsto -omega\nomega mapsto frac1sqrt2 (kappa + omega)\nfrac1sqrt2 (kappa + omega) mapsto kappa\n\nThe two spin-vectors, along with their sum and subtraction, are all in a straight line.","category":"section"},{"location":"newsreport.html#The-Story","page":"News Report","title":"The Story","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"newsreport.html#Who","page":"News Report","title":"Who","text":"(Image: 24)\n\nThe fact that there are 8 gluons, 3 weak gauge bosons, and 1 photon is related to the dimensions of the Lie groups SU(3) and SU(2) times U(1).

In the following, we explain how the system works through a robotics application. In this section, we see how the system works. But in the next section, we build a regulator to control the system state by generating suitable inputs for a given time frame.\n\nThe policy function produces the control inputs u(t) (or u(k) in the descrete case). The feeadback policy is called optimal control whenever it makes the system state x approximately equal to zero as the result of its application. The feeback policy is able to adapt through periodic policy updates. Between each two consecutive policy updates, a recursive relation updates filter coefficients, blocks of which are used to update the policy function. The policy update loop is slower whereas the filter coefficients update loop is faster.\n\nThe function h, which produces the output y, and the quality Q(x u) are similar functions. The similarity of h(x u) and the quality function Q(x u) is first because both have the same parameter signature that includes the statem state vector x and the input vector u. Second, because both h and Q produce verifiable statements about the value of the ststem state at the next time step k + 1 or t in the immediate future. Later in the next section, we see how a least squares relation can be used to calculate a difference equation between the desired state and the measured state, as a feedback signal for enhancing the quality function Q and producing accurate outputs y over time.\n\nOn one hand, the filter coefficients play the role of a critic that evaluates the quality of being in state x and having taken input u. On the other hand, the policy plays the role of an actor that uses the system state x as input to a matrix-vector product that produces the feedback policy u. The Actor/Critic architechture uses the first principles of reinforcement learning for adapting the optimal control inputs.

As it is known from the name, this robot has only one wheel and therefore has one contact point with the ground surface. Just one contact point is the reason it is more complex compared to two-wheel balance robots. In fact, the robot has to preserve it balance in two directions around two perpendicular axes. In this robot, the motion in the forward/backward direction is like balancing a two-wheel balance robots, and so it obeys the same laws of physics. But since the robot has no way of moving to either left or right, in order to balance along the left/right direction we have to use another torque generator. For that purpose, we use a rotating mass, which is also called a reaction wheel. This rotating mass, which is mounted at the top of the robot, works based on the physical principle that if we apply a torque on it until it starts moving, then that mass also applies a torque on the robot's chassis, as large as the torque that is applied to it. One of the physical principles called the preservation of angular momentum explains this phenomenon. According to this principle, the sum of the angular momenta of a rotating set around a specific axis remains constant, unless it is acted upon by an external torque. So if one of the parts of the rotating set starts rotating using its internal torque, then the complement of the part (the other parts of the set) start rotating in the opposite direction in order to neutralize the internal motion of that part. Otherwise the angular momentum of the entire set will not be preserved. Using this reaction torque we can take control of the angle of the robot's bofy in the left and right directions.\n\nThe one-wheel balance robot may not seem so practical at first, but similar to two-wheel balance robots, or different kinds of the inverted pendulum, provides proper conditions for experimenting with various control algorithms. In addition, the most important part of the robot, the reaction wheel has a special application in satellites. After a satellite is placed into orbit around a celestial body, the only force acting on it is caused by the gravitational field. Therefore, it will have no control over its own motion. In order for the satellite to make small maneuvres along its path, or to be able to make small adjustments to its orbit, usually they equip it with three motion systems: the propulsion motor, the electromagnetic torque generator, or the reaction wheel. The first item is outside of the scope of this project. The reaction wheel is applied in satellites by rotating the wheel in the opposite direction for as much as needed for pointing at a specific direction. The amount of rotation is determined based on the ratio of the rotational momenta between the satellite and the wheel. To control the rotation of the satellite in all spatial directions, it is equipped with three wheels that are mounted in mutually perpendicular directions. Professional motorcyclists also take advantage of this property of the preservation of rotational inertia. Whenever a motorcyclist makes a jump and is detatched from the Earth, The only force acting on in that moment is the gravity of the Earth, which is outside of the control of the cyclist. In this situation, the cyclist can set its landing angle (attack vector) by accelerating the rear wheel or decelerating (braking). The effect of the reaction of the rear wheel that is applied to the body of the motorcycle, rotates the whole system in the upward or downward direction. To build this robot, it is required to become familiar with the mechanical structure, mathematical modelling, control algorithms, digital design and electronic circuits.","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#The-Z-Euler-Angle-Is-Not-Observable","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"The Z-Euler Angle Is Not Observable","text":"The control and navigation of mobile robots is not pissible without knowing the position.

You should know that the gravitational field of the Earth has an effect on the measurements of an accelerometer. This issue makes it harder to find the position, but it is useful for measuring the deviation from the gravitational direction (the vertical line). Also, the gyroscope essentially measures the angular velocity, after which it will be possible to calculate the angular position (direction) using integration. This way, with the help of accelerometrs and gyroscopes you have the ability to measure the position and orientation of the motion of your robot, and in particular the estimate of the angle of deviation from the vertical line (the direction of gravity) is possible.","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Acclerometers","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Acclerometers","text":"Every accelerometer based on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) has some sort of moving part inside of it, such that it moves under the influence of external forces. This part is held in place using a spring structure, and the displacement caused by the external force on it, is measured using various methods such as the change in capacitance. The Hooke's law states that the force excerted by a spring is directly proportional to the displacement caused by that force. Then, knowing the spring constant (the force per unit of distance traveled) and the mass of the part, this displacement is transformed to its equivalent acceleration. Therefore, MEMS accelerometers measure an external force excerted on the moving part. That is why these accelerometers measure the static acceleration (the Earth's gravity) and the dynamical acceleration (due to changes in velocity) the same and decomposing the two measurements is your responsibility. In this way, if the direction of the accelerometer is in the direction of the Earth's gravitational field, then the measurement value is the representation of the acceleration due to motion in addition to the gravitational acceleration (98 fracms^2). And if the direction of the measurement of the sensor is in the horizontal direction (perpendicular to the gravitational field of the Earth) then only the dynamical acceleration is measured and gravity will not have any effect on the measurement. So, in case a one-axis accelerometer (capable of measuring in one of the directions of the coordinate system) is used in a system, the orientation of it must be specified with respect to the gravitational direction so that the static acceleration is computable.\n\n(Image: two_axis_accelerometer)\n\nUsing a two-axis accelerometer for measuring the direction of the Earth's gravity in the plane perpendicular to the Earth. In this figure, the orientation of the two-axis accelerometer (X-Y) with respect to the horizontal direction is computable using the given relation.\n\nalpha = tan^-1(fracA_XA_Y)\n\nNow, imagine that you have two or three accelerometers such that their directions of measurement are mutually orthogonal (like the X, Y, and Z coordinate axes of the standard Cartesian coordinate system). If the velocity of this set is constant and only the static accelration due to gravity acts on it, by comparing the ratio of the measured accelerations across the axes, the orientation angle of the set with respect to the direction of gravity is computable. This is the way that many electronic balances and mobile robots use to measure the angle of orientation with respect to the direction of gravity.\n\n(Image: tri_axis_accelerometer)\n\nUsing a tri-axis accelerometer for measuring the direction of the Earth's gravity in the three-dimensional space. In this figure, the orientation of the three-axis accelerometer (X-Y-Z) with respect to the hirozontal plane and the direction of gravity is computable using the given relations.\n\nalpha = tan^-1(fracA_XOUTsqrtA^2_YOUT + A^2_ZOUT)\n\nbeta = tan^-1(fracA_YOUTsqrtA^2_XOUT + A^2_ZOUT)\n\ngamma = tan^-1(fracsqrtA^2_XOUT + A^2_YOUTA_ZOUT)\n\nNote that knowing the angles between each axis and the direction of gravity, does not give the general angular orientation of the accelerometer in the three-dimensional space. In fact, if this accelerometer is rotated about an axis parallel to gravity, all three axes will measure the same result compared to before the rotation. The reason for the Z-Euler angle not being observable is that the projection of the gravity vector onto the horizontal plane looks like a point (approximately the zero vector). In order to determine the angular orientation of the accelerometer in a complete way, it needs to measure at least two known vectors that are not parallel with respect to each other (the gravity vector and another vector). In every case, using a three-axis accelerometer one can build an electronic balance that can measure tilt in two mutually perpendicular directions.\n\nMany manufacturers, make two-axis and tri-axis accelerometers as one chip, where two and three accelerometers (respectively) are placed in perpendicular directions in a unit package.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems of using accelerometrs to measure deviation, is the effect of dynamical accelerations (caused by changes in velocity) on the measurement of direction. For example, if you install such a device on a car and want to measure the slope of the road, the measured direction is correct as long as the vehicle has constant velocity. But when the car's velocity changes, the vector of dynamical acceleration is added to the vector of static acceleration and your measuring device measures the direction of this new vector (which is different from the direction of the Earth's gravity). One other disadvantage of accelerometers is the sensitivity to vibrations and the production of noisy results.\n\n(Image: estimating_the_road_slope)\n\nEstimating the slope of the road through measuring the direction of gravity using the accelerometer that is embedded in the car. In (a) the car has positive acceleration (increasing velocity), and in (b) without acceleration (constant velocity), and in (c) the car has negative acceleration (braking). As you can see, only in the figure (b) the direction of gravitational acceleration and the slope of the road are measured correctly.\n\nSensitivity to vibrations and dependence on dynamical accelerations, make it necessary to get help from other sensors such as gyroscopes and the magnetic field sensor (the electronic compass) for measuring the direction of the Earth's gravity.\n\nTo choose an accelerometer, one should pay attention to the measurement range, the sampling rate, the interface (the analog or digital communication protocol) and also the number of axes that are needed in the project (the number dimensions). Other parameters that should be considered in MEMS accelerometers are sensitivity to temperature and supply voltage changes, and the existence of an initial offset (the value read at zero acceleration), which is corrected with calbration. Here, we show how to use three-axis accelerometers.","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Gyroscopes","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Gyroscopes","text":"As you know, a gyroscope essentially measures the angular velocity about an axis. A rotation about an axis is measured with a specific value (often in terms of degrees per second fracdegs) and a rotation in the opposite direction results in a value with the opposite sign, and in the case where the rotation is stopped, the value of zero is measured. Mechanical gyroscopes that work based on coriolis forces / the coriolis effect of a rotating mass, had been used in airplanes and rockets for a while until optical gyroscopes and various kinds of MEMS were built. Among gyroscopes, optical gyroscopes are the most accurate, whereas the MEMS gyroscopes are the cheapest and the most applied type of this measuring device.\n\nUnlike accelerometers, a gyroscope is not generally sensitive to vibrations and produces more continuous measurement results. But, since the angular velocity is not that useful on its own, and the angular orientation is more useful to mobile vehicles, the output of this sensor is integrated to extract the angular position. Having an integrator in a positioning system based on gyroscopes causes the accumulation of the smallest offsets and unavoidable permanent errors over time to produce greater errors. As such, the angular position computed by  the integrator using the output of the gyroscope drifts away from the real value over time, so much that after the passgae of a few minutes (or even a few seconds) the computed values are no longer valid. This issue forces the use of other sensors such as a detector of the Earth's magnetic field or an acclerometer along with the gyroscope, unless the goal of measurement is only the angular velocity and not the angular position, in which case the integrator is removed and the output of the gyroscope will be accurate enough.\n\nLike MESMS accelerometers, MEMS gyroscopes are manufactured in small sizes with afforable prices, and many manufacturers provide two or three gyroscopes in a single electronic package for measurements along different directions that are perpendicular with respect to one another.\n\n(Image: tri_axis_gyroscope)\n\nA three-axis gyroscope measures the angular velocity about three mutually perpenducular axes (X, Y and Z). Ususally, the right-handed rotation about each axis is denoted by the positive sign and the left-handed rotation is denoted by the negative sign. The angular velocity is expressed in terms of degrees per second fracdegs. In flying vehicles such as rockets and airplanes and also some mobile robots, the names Roll, Yaw and Pitch are used to label the rotation axes. The axes Roll, Yaw and Pitch are not necessarily aligned with the X, Y and Z axes and this fact depends on the assignment of the coordinate system axes to the mobile object.\n\nWhen choosing a gyroscope, one should consider its measurable velocity range, the sampling rate, the way to communicate with it (analog or digital), and also the number of required axes in the project (the number of dimensions). In addition to those parameters, consider issues such as the sensitivity to temperature and supply voltage changes, the initial offset (the value read in the stationary state) and the cross-sxis sensitivity. If a gyroscope is rotated around an axis perpendicular to the measurement axis, it should measure the value zero, but it is not the case in practice. The gyroscope can show sensitivity to rotation in directions other than the one that is to be measured. This value, which must be as small as possible, represents the cross-axis sensitivity and is expressed in terms of the error percentage.","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Fusing-the-Output-Data-of-Accelerometers-with-that-of-Gyroscopes","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Fusing the Output Data of Accelerometers with that of Gyroscopes","text":"In this section we want to use the data of both accelerometers and gyroscopes in order to estimate the correct direction of gravity. A tri-axis accelerometer alone can be used to find the orientation with respect to the gravity vector. However, this estimate is correct only when there are no accelerations acting on the system other than the static gravitational acceleration. This is not possible in mobile robots. On top of that, an accelerometer is very sensitive to vibrations and due to too much noise, its output does not have much value on its own. In contrast, gyroscopes have their own disadvantages, the most important of which is the gradual drifting of the calculated angle from the real value, which is calculated using integration over time. Fortunately, the errors existing in acclerometers and gyroscopes are completely different in nature, such that by using the sensors in the proper way, one can correct both errors. For an effective application of the two sensors, one must fuse their data together in a way that the fused result is more valid than the result of each sensor on its own.\n\nAssuming that there are no long-term dynamical accelerations acting on the system, and so assuming that the direction of gravity has been calculated in a correct way, you can subtract the gravity vector of the Earth (the direction of which is known and its magnitude is approximately equal to 98 fracms^2) from the filtered information of the accelerometer to get the dynamical acceleration of the motion. By integrating the dynamical acceleration you can calculate the velocity of motion and the position of the robot. But these results are valid short-term because of the integral operation. To prevent the accumulation of error over a long period of time, it is necessary to add another positioning sensor such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) to the set.\n\n(Image: sensor_fusion)\n\nAs you know, in a positioning system including tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers (having six degrees of freedom), the gravity vector calculated using the accelerometer is like a yardstick that counteracts the effect of the gradual drift of the gyroscope from the estimation of the direction of gravity. But this vector does not have any projections on the horizontal plane. In addition, knowing the direction and magnitude of a known vector (like the gravity vector) in an orthogonal coordinate system, it is not possible to determine the direction of all three coordinate axes at the same time. In fact, one can show that there are an infinite number of coordinate systems that measure a particular vector the same (if you rotate a coordinate system about an axis parallel to that particular vector, all coordinate systems that are created as a result of rotating the coordinate system through various angles about the axis, measure the said vector the same). To detect the orientation of a coordinate system in the three-dimensional space, we have to have the measurement results of a pair of non-parallel vectors in the coordinate system. The coordinate system that we want to find the orientation of, is our Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). That is why the output of a data fusion algorithm that uses the information of tri-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes, is not a valid source to find the orientation around the vertical axis (the Z-axis). To solve this problem one must use another vector that has a substantial projection on the horizontal plane. An electronic compass can accomplish this goal. Positioning systems in flying machines generally take advantage of all three sensors: compasses, gyroscopes and accelerometers (having nine degrees of freedom), and the fusion algorithms in them process the information of all of the sensors.","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Estimating-Tilt-Using-Accelerometers","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Estimating Tilt Using Accelerometers","text":"In this section, we find an estimator for the roll and pitch angles of a rigid body that has only rotational degrees of freedom.

Therefore, the body has three rotational degrees of freedom, but has no translational degrees of freedom. The origin of the coordinate system of the body, which is denoted by hatB, is at the center of rotation. The inertial reference frame is denoted by hatO, the origin of which is coincident with the origin of the body's frame hatB. On the body, there are L sensors that are mounted at specific locations p_i, for i = 1  L. It is assumed that the position of sesnors ^Bp_i is known in the reference frame of the body. Each sensor hatA_i measures the local acceleration along three directions in its local frame. Two rotation matrices are introduced to describe the rotation of the rigid body and the mounting orientaton of the sensors: the first matrix describes the rotation of the inertial reference frame hatO with respect to the body's frame hatB, and the second matrix determines the rotation of the ith sensor's local reference frame with respect to the body's frame.\n\nleft beginarrayl ^O_BR  ^A_i_BR endarray right\n\nFor example, a vector ^Bv in the body's reference frame can be represented in the inertial reference frame with a matrix-vector multiplication ^Ov = ^O_BR  ^Bv.\n\n(Image: the_problem_setup)\n\nAn accelerometer, measures ^A_im_i the acceleration vector ^Oddotp_i at its mounting position in addition to the gravity vector ^Og, which is rotated with respect to its local frame hatA_i.\n\n^A_im_i = ^A_i_BR  ^B_OR (^Oddotp_i + ^Og) + ^A_in_i  (Equation 1)\n\nIn equation 1, the measurement of the accelerometer is denoted by ^A_im_i in mathbbR^3 and the measurement noise is denoted by ^A_in_i in mathbbR^3. It is assumed that it is the white noise, and its value mathbbE^An_i  (^An_i)^T = sigma_n^2 I_3 is limited by the zero mean mathbbE^An_i = 0 and the standard deviation sigma_n. Here, the mathematical expected value is denoted by mathbbE and the matrix I_3 in mathbbR^3 times 3 is the identity matrix of real dimension three. This model of noise is reasonable for acclerometers that are based on the MEMS technology provided that the bias is subtracted from it.\n\nUsing the coordinate transformation ^Op_i = ^O_BR ^Bp_i and the fact that ^Bp_i is constant in time fracd  ^Bp_idt = 0, we arrive at the conclusion that the acceleration ^Oddotp_i in terms of the inertial reference frame hatO is calculated using the second derivative of the rotation matrix ^O_BddotR with respect to time fracd^2  ^O_BRdt^2 = ^O_BddotR. The matrix ^O_BddotR captures the dynamic terms of the rigid body: the rotational and centripetal acceleration terms.\n\n^Oddotp_i = ^O_BddotR  ^Bp_i  (Equation 2)\n\nUsing equation 2, one can rewrite the acceleration measurement in equation 1 as follows:\n\n^A_im_i = ^A_i_BR  ^B_OR (^O_BddotR  ^Bp_i + ^Og) + ^A_in_i  (Equation 3)\n\nSince all of the rotational orientations of the sensors, denoted by ^A_i_BR, are assumed to be known, we can represent the sensor measurements ^A_im_i in terms of the body's frame of reference hatB by multiplying equation 3 on the left with the transpose of the rotation matrix ^B_A_iR = ^A_i_BR^T.\n\n^Bm_i = tildeR ^Bp_i + ^Bg + ^Bn_i  (Equation 4)\n\nIn equation 4, the matrix tildeR combines the rotation of the body ^B_OR and the dynamic terms of the motion of the body ^O_BddotR using a matrix-matrix product: tildeR = ^B_OR  ^O_BddotR.\n\n^Bg = ^B_OR  ^Og  (Equation 5)\n\nAlso in equation 4, the gravity vector ^Bg is represented in terms of the body's reference fame hatB, and the noise vector ^Bn_i is rotated with respect to the body's frame ^Bn_i = ^B_A_iR  ^A_in_i. The mean of the noise after the coordinate transformation is still equal to zero mathbbE^Bn_i = 0, and the standard deviation of the noise is still limited to the scalar multiplication of sigma_n^2 with the three-dimensional identity matrix: mathbbE^Bn_i (^Bn_i)^T = sigma_n^2 I_3.\n\nSuppose that the measurements are done at a rate T and the time index is introduced as k.

For example, one could directly measure gravity with a single tri-axis accelerometer at the pivot, where the dynamic terms do not enter the measurements.However, this is not possible for the balancing unicycle application.","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Tilt-Estimation","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Tilt Estimation","text":"With the estimate ^Bhatg of the gravity vector in the body frame, one can use equation (5) to estimate the body rotation, since the direction of the gravity vector in the inertial frame is known.

The passive structure of the unicycle is balanced on a wheel. There is a reaction wheel that is mounted on top of the rolling wheel, generating torque in the perpendicular direction for keeping the robot in equilibrium. The pitch and roll angles of the robot are estimated from measurements of two inertial measurement units (IMUs) with tri-axis accelerometers and rate gyros using the algorithm presented in the section above. The noise level of the estimate is further reduced by straightforward fusion with data from the rate gyros. Experimental results are provided in the next section.\n\nThe balancing unicycle robot consists of a rigid body in the shape of a rectangular cuboid with two orthogonally attached rotors. The objective is to balance the robot on the bottom wheel. In this configuration, the rigid body has three rotational degrees of freedom, and one translational degree of freedom. One can assume that the robot pivot does not slip due to friction, but rolls freely along a straight line. On the robot chassis, a pair of IMUs are mounted that measure accelerations and angular velocities each along three axes.\n\nThe wheels are actuated by DC motors and rotate relative to the robot structure. When the wheels rotate, they exert inertia reactional and ground reactional forces (by generating angular momenta and towing force) on the robot structure. An absolute encoder is used on each motor to measure the angle of a wheel relative to its mounting axle. Furthermore, the robot carries its own power unit and a computer that is connected to the sensors and the DC motors. The computer is also connected to a WiFi module to broadcast all its local sensor measurements to the terminal of a workstation.\n\n(Image: electronics_system)\n\nA state feedback controller is designed that stabalizes the unstable equilibrium of an upright standing robot. Estimates for the chassis angles are obtained from the tilt estimation algorithm of the section above. Although the details of the controller design are explained in the next section, a brief explanation of the control system follows.\n\nFoe both wheels, an inner feedback loop is closed for the chassis velocity. The inner-loop controller, which is the critic loop in the Actor/Critic architecture, ensures that velocity commands are tracked at a faster rate than the natural dynamics of the chassis. This way, one can neglect nonlinear effects such as friction and backlash in the actuation mechanism. A linear dynamical model (a linear quadratic regulator) about the equilibrium that takes into account the effect of the inner loop is obtained using a two-timescale technique, where the outer loop updates the actor of the controller. Updating the control policy in the outer-loop results in a stabalizing controller.\n\nThe sensors can generate estimates of all system states: the wheels' angular velocities are calculated using measurements by encoders, estimates of the motors' electrical current rates result from a difference equation using measurements by Hall effect sensors, and estimates of the robot's pitch and roll angles and their rates and accelerations are derived from the IMU measurements. Note that for balancing, knowledge of yaw is not required. Hence, a centralized full-state feedback LQR controller can be designed for stabalizing the system.","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#The-Implemetation-of-the-Tilt-Estimation-Algorithm","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"The Implemetation of the Tilt Estimation Algorithm","text":"The coordinate frame definitions and the locations of the two IMUs and the pivot point on the robot's chassis are indicated in the figure below.\n\n(Image: gravity_vector_estimation_lean_back)\n\nThe position vectors of the sensors are\n\n^Op_1 = beginbmatrix -01400  -00650  -00620 endbmatrix^T and\n\n^Op_2 = beginbmatrix -00400  -00600  -00600 endbmatrix^T.\n\nAlso the position of the pivot point in the inertial coordinate frame is\n\n^Opivot = beginbmatrix -0097  -01  -0032 endbmatrix^T\n\nWith this data, matrix P can be constructed as in equation (10).\n\nP in mathbbR^4 times L\n\nL = 2\n\nP in mathbbR^4 times 2\n\nthe unicycle graphical dashboard for taking the measurements\n\n^Op_1 = beginbmatrix p_1x  p_1y  p_1z endbmatrix\n\n^Op_2 = beginbmatrix p_2x  p_2y  p_2z endbmatrix\n\n^Opivot = beginbmatrix pivot_x  pivot_y  pivot_z endbmatrix\n\nP = beginbmatrix 1  1  p_1x - pivot_x  p_2x - pivot_x  p_1y - pivot_y  p_2y - pivot_y  p_1z - pivot_z  p_2z - pivot_z endbmatrix\n\nApplying the partitioned estimation lemma yields the optimal fusion matrix for estimating the gravity vector in the robot's body frame,\n\nX = P^T (P P^T)^-1 in mathbbR^L times 4 longrightarrow X in mathbbR^2 times 4,\n\nX_1^* = beginbmatrix 0586913  -113087  0747681  00  0446183  892749  -354337  00 endbmatrix.\n\nIn the implementation of the algorithm, all accelerometer measurements are rotated to the body frame and stacked into the matrix M(k) as in equation (8) at each time step. Then, equations (20) and (26) are implemented to obtain the accelerometric estimates for the pitch and roll angles, hatbeta_a(k) and hatgamma_a(k).\n\nIn order to reduce the noise level of the accelerometer-based estimates, a straightforward scheme for data fusion with the tri-axis rate gyro measurements may be used. Let r(k) in mathbbR^3 denote the body angular rate at time k, which is directly measured by a gyro that is mounted on the body. Thus, an estimate hatr(k) of this quantity may be obtained by averaging the measurements of all two gyros. The body rates are transformed to Euler angular rates by\n\nbeginbmatrix hatdotalpha(k)  hatdotbeta(k)  hatdotgamma(k) endbmatrix = beginbmatrix 0  sin(hatgamma)  cos(hatbeta)  cos(hatgamma)  cos(hatbeta)  0  cos(hatgamma)  -sin(hatgamma)  1  sin(hatgamma) tan(hatbeta)  cos(hatgamma) tan(hatbeta) endbmatrix hatr(k),  (Equation 27)\n\nwhich requires estimates of the Euler angles hatbeta and hatgamma. For a straightforward implementation, the most recent estimate may be used as an approximation, i.e. hatbeta = hatbeta(k - 1) and hatgamma = hatgamma(k - 1).\n\nIntegrating the rate estimates in equation (27) yields estimates for the Euler angles that are based on the rate gyro measurements. Thus, the accelerometer- and gyro-based estimates can be fused to obtain a better overall estimate of the robot pitch and roll angles,\n\nleft beginarrayl hatbeta(k) = kappa_1 hatbeta_a(k) + (1 - kappa_1) (hatbeta(k - 1) + T hatdotbeta(k))  hatgamma(k) = kappa_2 hatgamma_a(k) + (1 - kappa_2) (hatgamma(k - 1) + T hatdotgamma(k)) endarray right,  (Equation 28)\n\nwhere T is the sampling time (the same as dt in the LQR struct) and kappa_1 and kappa_2 are tuning parameters that may be chosen such that the variance of the estimate is minimized given the noise specifications of accelerometers and rate gyros.

The critic loop operates at a faster timescale and finds filter coefficients by taking actions, making mesurements and computing a recursive algorithm. In contrast, the actor loop is slower and updates the control policy, which is a function that produces actions. Even though actions are taken in the critic loop, the feedback policy function is the same across multiple runs of the loop. The actor loop is where the feedback policy is updated as a function of the latest set of filter coefficients.

The user must connect the fuse bit and also push a blue push button once on the robot for activating the model. The push button is the same blue button that is found on the NUCLEOF401RE board. These two conditions are chained together for safety reasons. If the model is not active, then the robot must stop moving by calling the function resetActuators.\n\n(Image: buttonsandlights)\n\nelapsedTime1 = DWT->CYCCNT;\nif (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_0) == 0)\n{\n  if (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_13) == 0)\n  {\n    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, GPIO_PIN_RESET);\n    model.active = 1;\n  }\n}\nelse\n{\n  model.active = 0;\n  resetActuators(&model);\n}\n\nWhen the reaction wheel unicycle falls over, the roll and pitch angles of the chassis with respect to the pivot point exceed ten degrees. It makes sense to disable the actuators after a fall has been detected to both save energy and minimize physical shock to gearboxes. The lower and upper bounds on the roll and pitch angles are combined using the logical \"or\" operator || with the episode counter so that the model stops running after the maximum number of interactions with the environment, the total steps in an episode. A fall or a certain number of interactions, whichever comes first, must cause the model to deactivate on its own. When the model is deactivated, the green light on the NUCLEOF401RE turns on to signify that the controller is no longer active. The user has four options whenever the green LED lights up:\n\nPick the robot up and make it stand upright, before pushing the blue push button to run again.\nSwitch the power button on the chassis to condition zero, in order to power off the robot.\nConnect to the robot WiFi network and execute the following command in the terminal for printing the logs.

Instead, the outOfBoundsCounter is incremented every time the safety conditions are violated and is decremented otherwise. Then the model is deactivated if the out of bounds counter is greater than maxOutOfBounds. This approach reduces the probability that a discontinous state estimation is able to trigger deactivation.\n\nif (fabs(model.imu1.roll) > model.rollSafetyAngle || fabs(model.imu1.pitch) > model.pitchSafetyAngle || model.j > model.maxEpisodeLength)\n{\n  model.outOfBoundsCounter = model.outOfBoundsCounter + 1;\n}\nelse\n{\n  model.outOfBoundsCounter = fmax(0, model.outOfBoundsCounter - 1);\n}\n\nif (model.outOfBoundsCounter > model.maxOutOfBounds)\n{\n  model.active = 0;\n  HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_5, GPIO_PIN_SET);\n}\n\nThe microcontroller is built around a Cortex-M4 with Floating Point Unit (FPU) core, which contains hardware extensions for debugging features. The debug extensions allow the core to be stopped either on a given instruction fetch (breakpoint), or on data access (watchpoint). When stopped, the core's internal state and the system's external state may be examined. Once examination is complete, the core and the system may be restored and program execution resumed.\n\n(Image: nucleof401re)\n\nThe ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core provides integrated on-chip debug support. One of the debug features is called Data Watchpoint Trigger (DWT). The DWT unit provides a means to give the number of clock cycles. The DWT register CYCCNT counts the number of clock cycles. The period of a control loop is required in the application for integrating the gyroscopic angle rates. If we count the number of clocks twice: one time before the loop begins and one time after the loop ends, then we can find the time period that it takes to complete a control loop. In the beginning, we count the number of clocks by assigning the register value to a local variable called t1.\n\nAt the end of the control loop, where the model has taken one step forward, it is time to count the number of the processor's clock cycles for a second time for measuring delta t. At this point, by assigning the value of the DWT counter register to the variable t2 we can know how many cycles are there between t1 and t2. Then divide the difference by the number of Central Processing Unit (CPU) clock cycles per second cpuClock for finding the period of the control loop. The field dt of the model struct saves the control period.\n\nIf the model is set to active, then the controller takes one step forward. The function stepForward takes as argument a pointer to the model, mainly because two of its fields require persistent memory across runs: the filter matrix W_n and the inverse autocorrelation matrix P_n. The system state estimation is done by calling updateSensors. But since we extend the meaning of the value function to the quality function Q(x u), the states x_k are appended by the inputs u_k, which in turn are computed by calling computeFeedbackPolicy. The function call applyFeedbackPolicy applies the action of the feedback policy, changing the angular velocity of the motors.\n\nQ(x u) = Q(z) = W^T phi(z)\n\nx_k in mathbbR^n  u_k in mathbbR^m\n\nIn the case where the model is active, the critic loop is run for a few times before the policy is updated by calling the updateControlPolicy function. However, when the model in not active, neither the critic loop nor the actor loop are executed. During the inactive mode of operation, the program makes measurements by calling the functions updateSensors and computeFeedbackPolicy, and resets the actuators by calling the function resetActuators.\n\nif (model.active == 1)\n{\n  t1 = DWT->CYCCNT;\n  updateSensors(&model);\n  computeFeedbackPolicy(&model);\n  applyFeedbackPolicy(&model);\n  stepForward(&model);\n  if (fabs(model.changes) < 2.0)\n  {\n    updateControlPolicy(&model);\n  }\n  model.logCounter = model.logCounter + 1;\n  t2 = DWT->CYCCNT;\n  diff = t2 - t1;\n  model.dt = (float)diff / model.CPUClock;\n}\nelse\n{\n  model.logPeriod = 80;\n  t1 = DWT->CYCCNT;\n  resetActuators(&model);\n  updateSensors(&model);\n  computeFeedbackPolicy(&model);\n  model.logCounter = model.logCounter + 1;\n  t2 = DWT->CYCCNT;\n  diff = t2 - t1;\n  model.dt = (float)diff / model.cpuClock;\n}\n\nIn order to monitor the controller and debug issues, we write the logs periodically to the standard input / output console. The variable log_counter is incremented by one every control cycle. Then, the log counter variable logCounter is compared to the constnt logPeriod for finding out if a cycle should be logged. But it is not a sufficient condition for logging, because a second fuse bit is also rquired for permission to log. The second fuse bit is connected to the port C of the general purpose input / output, pin 1. Whenever the fuse bit pin is grounded, it is activated. Once the fuse bit is active, the local transmission flag transmit is set at the relevant control cycle count. The reason for logPeriod is to limit the total number of logs per second, as the Micro-Controller Unit (MCU) is too fast for a continuous report. And the second fuse bit is there to turn off logging for saving time, as log transmission takes time away from the control processes. So by using the logical \"and\" operator && we can combine the logging period condition with the logging fuse bit, in order to manage the frequnecy of transmissions.\n\nif (model.logCounter > model.logPeriod && HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOC, GPIO_PIN_1) == 0)\n{\n  transmit = 1;\n}\n\nIf the transmit variable is equal to one, then the log counter logCounter is cleard along with the transmit variable, before transmission. The function sprintf is called with a message buffer MSG and a formatted string to populate the buffer with numbers. A log message can be anything, but for finding the matrix of known parameters in tilt estimation, the accelerometrs data must be included. After the message is composed, it is given as an argument to the function HAL_UART_Transmit, which stands for: Hardware Abstraction Layer, Universal Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter, Transmit. The function also requires a pointer to uart6, which is a micro-controller peripheral for serial communications, and the size of the message buffer, along with a time out delay. Printing and transmitting the log finishes the actor loop. The console on the other side of tranmission should receive a line like this: AX1: -0.01, AY1: 1.03, AZ1: 0.00, | AX2: -0.05, AY2: 0.97, AZ2: -0.04, | roll: 0.03, pitch: -1.59, | encT: 0.46, encB: 4.31, | j: 1038.000000, | x0: -0.02, x1: -0.12, x2: 0.03, x3: -1.22, x4: -0.90, x5: 0.05, x6: 0.09, x7: -0.04, x8: 0.00, x9: -0.01, x10: 0.00, x11: 0.00, | P0: -96.08, P1: 0.27, P2: 2.04, P3: 1.18, P4: 1.36, P5: 0.34, P6: 0.03, P7: 0.77, P8: 0.08, P9: 0.57, P10: 62.48, P11: 62.48, dt: 0.001947.\n\nYou can visualize this example message using the Unicycle script.

The weighted least squares error is equal to the squared norm of the error at time i times an exponential weighting factor, sumed over the observation interval. Epsilon (n) = sum_i = 0^n lambda^n - i  e(i) ^2. The exponential weighting (forgetting) factor lambda is greater than zero and, less than or equal to one. 0  lambda leq 1. The error at time i is equal to the difference between the desired signal and the filter output. e(i) = d(i) - y(i) = d(i) - textbfw_n^T x(i). In the definition of the error, d(i) is the desired signal at time i, and y(i) is the filter output at time i. The filter output is the result of the matrix-vector product of the filter coefficients and the new data vector. The latest set of filter coefficients textbfw_n(k) is used for minimizing the weighted least squares error Epsilon (n). Also, it is assumed that the weights textbfw_n are constant over the observation interval 0 n with end points zero and n.\n\nFor the error minimization objective, the partial derivative of the weighted least squares error with respect to the filter coefficients must be equal to zero. Setting the partial derivative equal to zero minimizes the weighted least squares error fracpartial Epsilon (n)partial textbfw_n^* (k) = 0 for k = 0 1  p, where p denotes the filter order. Following the implications of the partial derivative equation, the filter coefficients are transformed by the exponentially weighted deterministic autocorrelation matrix textbfR_x(n) textbfw_n = textbfr_dx(n) in order to produce the deterministic cross-correlation between the desired signal d(n) = beginbmatrix d(n)  d(n - 1)  ldots  d(0) endbmatrix^T and the new data vector textbfx(i) = beginbmatrix x(i)  x(i - 1)  ldots  x(i - p) endbmatrix^T.\n\nTherefore, the deterministic normal equations define the optimum filter coefficients. The exponentially weighted deterministic autocorrelation matrix textbfR_x(n) in mathbbR^(p + 1) times (p + 1) for the new data vector textbfx(n) is defined as the sum of the outer product of the data vector with itself, in an exponential way with the given exponential factor lambda. In contrast, the deterministic cross-correlation textbfr_dx(n) is the outer product between the desired signal d(n) and the data vector textbfx(n).\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfr_dx(n) = sum_i = 0^n lambda^n - i d(i) textbfx^*(i)  textbfR_x(n) = sum_i = 0^n lambda^n - i textbfx^*(i) textbfx^T(i) endarray right\n\nMultiplying the filter coefficients with the deterministic cross-correlation on the left and then subtracting the result from the weighted norm of the desired signal  d(n) _lambda^2 yields the minimum error Epsilon(n)_min =  d(n) _lambda^2 - textbfr_dx^H(n) textbfw_n.\n\nBoth the deterministic autocorrelation matrix textbfR_x(n) and the deterministic cross-correlation textbfr_dx(n) depend on the time variable n. So instead of directly solving the deterministic normal equations textbfR_x(n) textbfw_n = textbfr_dx(n), it is easier to derive a recursive solution for the filter coefficients textbfw_n. A correction Delta textbfw_n - 1 that is applied to the solution at time n - 1 results in the filter coefficients textbfw_n = textbfw_n - 1 + Delta textbfw_n - 1 at time n.\n\nFor a recursive equation, first derive the deterministic cross-correlation textbfr_dx(n) at time n in terms of the cross-correlation textbfr_dx(n - 1) at time n - 1. To solve for the filter coefficients, multiply both sides of the deterministic normal equations on the left by the inverse of the deterministic autocorrelation matrix: textbfw_n = textbfR_x^-1(n) textbfr_dx(n). Second, derive the inverse of the deterministic autocorrelation matrix textbfR_x^-1(n) in terms of the inverse autocorrelation at the previous time textbfR_x^-1(n - 1) and the new data vector textbfx(n). On the one hand, the cross-correlation textbfr_dx(n) = sum_i = 0^n lambda^n - i d(i) textbfx^*(i) may be updated recursively as the sum of the previous cross-correlation times the weighting factor, and the desired signal times new data. On the other hand, the autocorrelation matrix textbfR_x(n) may be updated recursively from the autocorrlation of the previous time textbfR_x(n - 1) and the new data vector textbfx(n) in this way: multiply the previous autocorrelation by the weighting factor and then add the result to the outer product of the new data vector with itself.\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfr_dx(n) = lambda textbfr_dx(n - 1) + d(n) textbfx^*(n)  textbfR_x(n) = lambda textbfR_x(n - 1) + textbfx^*(n) textbfx^T(n) endarray right\n\nSince we are interested in the inverse of the autocorrelation matrix textbfR_x(n) we use the Woodbury's Identity. The Woodbury matrix identity (textbfA + textbfu textbfv^H)^-1 = textbfA^-1 - fractextbfA^-1 textbfu textbfv^H textbfA^-11 + textbfv^H textbfA^-1 textbfu says that the inverse of a rank-k correction of some matrix can be computed by doing a rank-k correction to the inverse of the original matrix. Therefore, the multiplication of the weighting factor lambda and the autocorrelation matrix textbfR_x(n - 1) at time n - 1 should be the original matrix textbfA, whereas the pair of vectors textbfu and textbfv in the identity are both equal to the new data vector textbfx^*(n).\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfA = lambda textbfR_x(n - 1)  textbfu = textbfv = textbfx^*(n) endarray right\n\ntextbfR_x^-1(n) = lambda^-1 textbfR_x^-1 (n - 1) - fraclambda^-2 textbfR_x^-1 (n - 1) textbfx^*(n) textbfx^T(n) textbfR_x^-1(n - 1)1 + lambda^-1 textbfx^T(n) textbfR_x^-1(n - 1) textbfx^*(n)\n\nWriting the inverse of the deterministic autocorrelation matrix using Woodbury's identity, textbfP(n) = lambda^-1 textbfP(n - 1) - textbfg(n) textbfx^T(n) textbfP(n -1), we find that the inverse of the autocorrelation matrix textbfP(n) = textbfR_x^-1(n) at time n involves two terms, one of which is the weighted version of the matrix at time n - 1. The other term in the calculation of the inverse matrix is the multiplication of the gain vector and the data vector and the inverse matrix at time n - 1. The gain vector is the solution to the equation textbfR_x(n) textbfg(n) = textbfx^*(n). As such, the gain vector textbfg(n) = fraclambda^-1 textbfP(n - 1) textbfx^*(n)1 + lambda^-1 textbfx^T(n) textbfP(n - 1) textbfx^*(n) is transformed by the deterministic autocorrelation matrix to yield the new data vector. Alternatively one can say that the new data vector is transformed by the inverse of the deterministic autocorrelation matrix in order to produce the gain vector textbfg(n) = textbfP(n) textbfx^*(n). This is the same as the deterministic normal equations, but the cross-correlation vector textbfr_dx(n) is replaced with the data vector textbfx^*(n):\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfR_x(n) textbfw_n = textbfr_dx(n)  textbfR_x(n) textbfg(n) = textbfx^*(n) endarray right\n\nmodel->x_n_dot_z_n = 0.0;\nfloat buffer = 0.0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n{\n  buffer = getIndexVec12(model->dataset, i) * getIndexVec12(model->z_n, i);\n  if (isnanf(buffer) == 0)\n  {\n    model->x_n_dot_z_n += buffer;\n  }\n}\nif (fabs(model->lambda + model->x_n_dot_z_n) > 0)\n{\n  for (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n  {\n    setIndexVec12(&(model->g_n), i, (1.0 / (model->lambda + model->x_n_dot_z_n)) * getIndexVec12(model->z_n, i));\n  }\n}\nelse\n{\n  for (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n  {\n    setIndexVec12(&(model->g_n), i, (1.0 / model->lambda) * getIndexVec12(model->z_n, i));\n  }\n}\n\nThe derivation of the time-update equation for the coefficient vector textbfw_n completes the recursion. Start with the fact that the transformation of the cross-correlation by the inverse autoccorrelation results in the filter coefficients. Then, replace the cross-correlation with the recursive solution.\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfw_n = textbfP(n) textbfr_dx(n)  textbfr_dx(n) = lambda textbfr_dx(n - 1) + d(n) textbfx^*(n) endarray right\n\nReplacing the solution with a recursive term gets us half of the way, because in the time-update equation we still need to replace the inverse autocorrelation matrix with a recursive inverse autocorrelation: textbfw_n = lambda textbfP(n) textbfr_dx(n - 1) + d(n) textbfP(n) textbfx^*(n). Recall that the transformation of the data vector by the inverse autocorrelation matrix gives us the gain vector. But we also established that the recursive relation of the inverse autocorrelation matrix includes the gain vector.\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfP(n) textbfx^*(n) = textbfg(n)  textbfP(n) = lambda^-1 textbfP(n - 1) - textbfg(n) textbfx^T(n) textbfP(n - 1) endarray right\n\nGiven these two facts, the time-update of the filter coefficients at time n is rewritten, textbfw_n = textbfP(n - 1) - textbfg(n) textbfx^T(n) textbfP(n - 1) textbfr_dx(n - 1) + d(n) textbfg(n), so that it becomes dependent on the inverse autocorrelation matrix at time n - 1. So far, the filter coefficients vector is derived in terms of the following: the filter coefficients at time n - 1, the gain vector at time n, the desired signal at time n, and the new data vector: textbfw_n = textbfw_n - 1 + textbfg(n) d(n) - textbfw_n - 1^T textbfx(n). To simplify the time-update equation, we use the filter coefficients at time n - 1 in place of the transformation of the cross-correlation by the inverse autocorrelation: textbfP(n - 1) textbfr_dx(n - 1) = textbfw_n - 1.\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n{\n  setIndexVec12(&(model->alpha_n), i, 0.0);\n}\nfor (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n{\n  for (int j = 0; j < (model->n + model->m); j++)\n  {\n    setIndexVec12(&(model->alpha_n), i, getIndexVec12(model->alpha_n, i) + 0.0 - getIndexMat12(model->W_n, i, j) * getIndexVec12(model->dataset, j));\n  }\n}\n\nHere is yet another simplification for defining the correction to the filter coefficients as the a priori error transforming the gain vector: textbfw_n = textbfw_n - 1 + alpha(n) textbfg(n). The a priori error alpha(n) = d(n) - textbfw_n - 1^T textbfx(n) is the difference relation between the desired signal d(n) at time n and the estimate of the desired signal textbfw_n - 1^T textbfx(n) using the previous set of filter coefficients textbfw_n - 1 at time n - 1.\n\nleft beginarrayl alpha(n) = d(n) - textbfw_n - 1^T textbfx(n)  e(n) = d(n) - textbfw_n^T textbfx(n) endarray right\n\nThe a priori error alpha(n) is defined as the error that would occur if the filter coefficients were not updated, whereas the a posteriori error e(n) is defined as the error that occurs after the weight vector textbfw_n is updated.\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n{\n  setIndexVec12(&(model->z_n), i, 0.0);\n}\nfor (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n{\n  for (int j = 0; j < (model->n + model->m); j++)\n  {\n    setIndexVec12(&(model->z_n), i, getIndexVec12(model->z_n, i) + getIndexMat12(model->P_n, i, j) * getIndexVec12(model->dataset, j));\n  }\n}\n\nThe definition of the filtered information vector textbfz(n) = textbfP(n - 1) textbfx^*(n)  makes the equations for the gain vector and the inverse of the deterministic autocorrelation matrix simple.\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfg(n) = fraclambda^-1 textbfP(n - 1) textbfx^*(n)1 + lambda^-1 textbfx^T(n) textbfP(n - 1) textbfx^*(n)  textbfP(n) = lambda^-1 textbfP(n - 1) - textbfg(n) textbfx^T(n) textbfP(n - 1) endarray right\n\nThe filtered information vector z(n) at time n is the transformation of the new data vector at time n by the inverse of the autocorrelation matrix at time n - 1.\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfg(n) = frac1lambda + textbfx^T(n) textbfz(n) textbfz(n)  textbfP(n) = frac1lambda textbfP(n - 1) - textbfg(n) textbfz^H(n) endarray right\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n{\n  for (int j = 0; j < (model->n + model->m); j++)\n  {\n    buffer = getIndexMat12(model->W_n, i, j) + getIndexVec12(model->alpha_n, i) * getIndexVec12(model->g_n, j);\n    if (isnanf(buffer) == 0)\n    {\n      setIndexMat12(&(model->W_n), i, j, buffer);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIn short, we derived five equations for minimizing the weighted least squares error Epsilon (n) in a recursive way: the filtered information vector, the a priori error, the gain vector, the filter coefficients, and the inverse of the autocorrelation matrix. These equations are parts of what is called the exponentially weighted Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm.\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfz(n) = textbfP(n - 1) textbfx^*(n)  alpha(n) = d(n) - textbfw_n - 1^T textbfx(n)  textbfg(n) = frac1lambda + textbfx^T(n) textbfz(n) textbfz(n)  textbfw_n = textbfw_n - 1 + alpha(n) textbfg(n)  textbfP(n) = frac1lambda textbfP(n - 1) - textbfg(n) textbfz^H(n) endarray right\n\nint scaleFlag = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n{\n  for (int j = 0; j < (model->n + model->m); j++)\n  {\n    buffer = (1.0 / model->lambda) * (getIndexMat12(model->P_n, i, j) - getIndexVec12(model->g_n, i) * getIndexVec12(model->z_n, j));\n    if (isnanf(buffer) == 0)\n    {\n      if (fabs(buffer) > model->clippingValue)\n      {\n        scaleFlag = 1;\n      }\n      setIndexMat12(&(model->P_n), i, j, buffer);\n    }\n  }\n}\nif (scaleFlag == 1)\n{\n  for (int i = 0; i < (model->n + model->m); i++)\n  {\n    for (int j = 0; j < (model->n + model->m); j++)\n    {\n      setIndexMat12(&(model->P_n), i, j, model->clippingFactor * getIndexMat12(model->P_n, i, j));\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhenever the weighting factor is equal to one, lambda = 1, the algorithm is called the growing window RLS algorithm, because it has infinite memory of the system's trajectory. Meaning the algorithm does not forget outliers, even though it can make the effects of older data less significant over time with a forgetting facter lambda less than one. But a sliding window variant of the algorithm can forget outlier at the cost of doubling the computation.\n\nThe recursive updating of the filter coefficients textbfw_n and the inverse autocorrelation matrix textbfP(n) requires initial conditions for both terms. A suggestion would be to initialize the deterministic autocorrelation matrix with the identity matrix multiplied by a small positive constant delta.\n\nleft beginarrayl textbfR_x(0) = delta textbfI  textbfP(0) = delta^-1 textbfI  textbfw_0 = textbf0 endarray right\n\nBut setting an initial zero vector for the filter coefficients does not minimize the weighted least squares error Epsilon(0), and so textbfw_0 is not an optimal initial vector. However, with an exponential weighting factor less than one, lambda  1, the bias in the least squares solution goes to zero as n increases.\n\nAn adaptive control algorithm based on Q learning that converges to the solution to the discrete-time LQR problem. This is accomplished by solving athe algebraic Riccati equation in real time without knowing the system dynamics by using data measured along the system trajectories.\n\nQ learning is implemented by repeatedly performing the iterations W_j + 1^T (phi (z_k) - gamma phi (z_k + 1)) = r (x_k h_j(x_k)) and h_j + 1 (x_k) = undersetuarg  min (W_j + 1^T phi (x_k u)), for all x in X. In it is seen that the LQR Q function is quadratic in the states and inputs so that Q(x_k u_k) = Q(z_k) equiv (frac12) z_k^T S z_k where z_k = beginbmatrix x_k^T  u_k^T endbmatrix.\n\nThe counter variable k is incremented every time the stepForward function is called for keeping track of the number of steps in an episode. This reminds us of the counter variable j, which counts the number of policy updates in the function updateControlPolicy. In the stepForward function, the variable k is incremented before returning to the main function. Repeat at the next time k + 1 and continue until RLS converges and the new parameter vector Wⱼ₊₁ is found.\n\nmodel->k = model->k + 1;","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Update-Control-Policy","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Update Control Policy","text":"void updateControlPolicy(LinearQuadraticRegulator *model)\n{\n  // unpack the vector Wⱼ₊₁ into the kernel matrix\n  // Q(xₖ, uₖ) ≡ 0.5 * transpose([xₖ; uₖ]) * S * [xₖ; uₖ] = 0.5 * transpose([xₖ; uₖ]) * [Sₓₓ Sₓᵤ; Sᵤₓ Sᵤᵤ] * [xₖ; uₖ]\n  model->k = 1;\n  model->j = model->j + 1;\n\n  for (int i = 0; i < model->m; i++)\n  {\n    for (int j = 0; j < model->n; j++)\n    {\n      setIndexMat210(&(model->Sux), i, j, getIndexMat12(model->W_n, model->n + i, j));\n    }\n  }\n  for (int i = 0; i < model->m; i++)\n  {\n    for (int j = 0; j < model->m; j++)\n    {\n      setIndexMat2(&(model->Suu), i, j, getIndexMat12(model->W_n, model->n + i, model->n + j));\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Perform the control update using (S24), which is uₖ = -S⁻¹ᵤᵤ * Sᵤₓ * xₖ\n  // uₖ = -S⁻¹ᵤᵤ * Sᵤₓ * xₖ\n  float determinant = getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 1, 1) * getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 2, 2) - getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 1, 2) * getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 2, 1);\n  // check the rank of S_uu to see if it's equal to 2 (invertible matrix)\n  if (fabs(determinant) > 0.001) // greater than zero\n  {\n    setIndexMat2(&(model->SuuInverse), 0, 0, getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 1, 1) / determinant);\n    setIndexMat2(&(model->SuuInverse), 0, 1, -getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 0, 1) / determinant);\n    setIndexMat2(&(model->SuuInverse), 1, 0, -getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 1, 0) / determinant);\n    setIndexMat2(&(model->SuuInverse), 1, 1, getIndexMat2(model->Suu, 0, 0) / determinant);\n    // initialize the gain matrix\n    for (int i = 0; i < model->m; i++)\n    {\n      for (int j = 0; j < model->n; j++)\n      {\n        setIndexMat210(&(model->K_j), i, j, 0.0);\n      }\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < model->m; i++)\n    {\n      for (int j = 0; j < model->n; j++)\n      {\n        for (int k = 0; k < model->m; k++)\n        {\n          setIndexMat210(&(model->K_j), i, j, getIndexMat210(model->K_j, i, j) + getIndexMat2(model->SuuInverse, i, k) * getIndexMat210(model->Sux, k, j));\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return;\n}\n\nQ(x_k u_k) = frac12 beginbmatrix x_k  u_k endbmatrix^T S beginbmatrix x_k  u_k endbmatrix = frac12 beginbmatrix x_k  u_k endbmatrix^T beginbmatrix S_xx  S_xu  S_ux  S_uu endbmatrix beginbmatrix x_k  u_k endbmatrix","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#The-Convergence-of-Selected-Algebraic-Riccati-Equation-Solution-Parameters","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"The Convergence of Selected Algebraic Riccati Equation Solution Parameters","text":"(Image: p_matrix_parameters_a)\n\nConvergence of selected algebraic Riccati equation solution parameters.

The LQR regulates the roll and pitch angles by a choice of a suitable input. There are four digital input pins: 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, and a pair of analog enable pins: 1,2En and 3,4EN. The enable pins control the speeds of rotation with a 16-bit resolution, whereas the logical input pins: 1A, 2A, 3A and 4A control the direction of rotation. A motor rotates in reverse by swapping the values of Input 1 with Input 2, switching 2 values in the memory. Therefore, LQR controls the roll and pitch angles by making changes to two variables: rollingPWM corresponding to 1,2EN and reactionPWM corresponding to 3,4EN. LQR adds / subtracts from the two variables when it acts in the environment. To drive a direct current actuator, the driver generates an electric potential at the two ends of the actuator's coil. An electric current in the power terminals (1Y and 2Y, or, 3Y and 4Y) occurs whenever the electric potential at the two end points are sufficiently different in intensity. The duty cycle of a PWM signal shapes the line graph of an analog voltage. In a Voltage versus Time graph, the PWM signal is a point on the graph and varies with time. There are two independent PWM signals: the reaction wheel's motor enable pin and the rolling wheel's motor enable pin. In turn, the duty cycles of the PWM signals, tell the Integrated Circuit (IC) to adjust the electric potential at the output pins of the IC: 1Y, 2Y, 3Y and 4Y. Making changes to the duty cycles with the given feedback policy u_k, the registers of channels one and two of Timer 2 are changed after scaling the variables and casting them to integer values.\n\n(Image: motordriver)\n\n(Image: L293D)\n\nThere is an encoder wheel at the opposite the end of the reaction wheel's motor. Since the gearbox reduces the speed of rotation of the reaction wheel in exchange for multiplying the output torque, the encoder's wheel rotates faster than the reaction wheel. The difference in the speed of rotation between the output reaction wheel and the input encoder wheel allows the encoder to be more precise. Also in the motor / encoder assembley, there is an array of small magnets on the circumference of the encoder's wheel. The resolution of the encoder depends on the number of magnets in the circular array and the gearbox ratio. A Hall effect sensor produces a voltage proportional to an axial component of the magnetic field vector produced by the magnetic array. The encoder measures the absolute position of the wheel using two channels. A pair of Hall effect sensors are mounted near the surface of the encoder's wheel, such that the magnets pass by the Hall effect sensors. Timer 3 of the MCU is set up to work in encoder mode, with a register of the absolute position of the encoder's wheel. When Timer 3 is in the encoder mode, it compares the pair of channels at each rising edge of the signals to find the position. Therefore, we call the encodeWheel function with a pointer to the Encoder object of the reaction wheel along with the value of the counter register of Timer 3. The function encodeWheel updates the velocity field of the reaction wheel's encoder struct to be used in the LQR model as a system state.\n\n(Image: motorb)\n\n(Image: AN503)\n\n(Image: AN503 and a disk magnet)\n\nThe rolling wheel's encoder works the same as the reaction wheel's encoder, except for the fact that the hardware of the channels sensors is photonic rather than magnetic. The rolling wheel encoder's disk has an alternating pattern of stripes on it for a pair of infrared light emmiting diodes and a pair of photo transistors to sense its rotation. The IR LEDs send light from one side of the wheel to be received by photo transistors on the other side through the alternating pattern. The amount of light received by the photo transistors is translated to two channels of representative electrical signals, which are fed to Timer 4 of the MCU. Supplying the encodeWheel function with a pointer to the rolling wheel's encoder object and the value of the counter register of Timer 4, the function call updates the wheel velocity. Before connecting the encoder signals to the MCU timer, a voltage division is applied for making sure the amplitudes of the signals do not exceed 3.3 volts.\n\n(Image: motora)\n\nThe senseCurrent function computes the current rates of the reaction and rolling motors. The function accepts two pointers of the CurrentSensor type and updates the currentVelocity field of the respective arguments. Measuring the electric current rate is the result of two Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) channels, as peripherals of the MCU (pins PC4 and PA4 of the ADC unit). A pair of Hall effect sensors are powered using a regulated 5-Volt direct current source. To measure the current rate of the driver's output, two of the wires that connect the driver IC pins (1Y and 4Y) to the respective motor coils (MotorA2 and MotorB2), are routed in such a way that they pass by the respective current sensing Hall effect sensors. When the IC drives a voltage across the motor terminals (MA1 and MA2, or MB1 and MB2), the Hall effect sensors measure the magnetic field vector that is caused by the electric field inside the wires between the motors and the driver. The ratio-metric readings from the magnetic field vectors represent the flows of the electric current of the reaction motor's and the rolling motor's coils. The LQR model observes the current rates and regulates them to zero by generating suitable inputs.\n\n(Image: currentsensing)\n\n(Image: ACS724)","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Fiber-Optic-Gyroscopes","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Fiber Optic Gyroscopes","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html#Resources","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Resources","text":"Yohanes Daud, Abdullah Al Mamun and Jian-Xin Xu, Dynamic modeling and characteristics analysis of lateral-pendulum unicycle robot, Robotica (2017) volume 35, pp. 537–568.

اما اگر در عوض  انتقال موازی آن را به سمت شرق در امتداد قطعه‌ی آر-پ از نیمگان ژیودزیک (با حفظ زاویه‌ی قایم نسبت به ژیودزیک) و سپس آن را به سمت شمال در امتداد نصف النهار ژیودزیک آر-پ حمل کنیم، به بردار

کنید که ما با بردار آ از نقطه‌ی پ شروع کنیم و سپس آن را به طور همرو به صورت پادساعت‌گرد به دور حلقه‌ی بسته انتقال دهیم، از نقطه‌ی پ به نقطه‌ی کیو و سپس به نقطه‌ی آر و در نهایت به نقطه‌ی پ. شکل نشان می‌دهد که بردار به نقطه‌ی پ باز می‌گردد در حالی که تحت چرخشی پادساعت‌گرد به اندازه‌ی آر دلتا برابر با زاویه‌ی تتا چرخانده شده‌است. این هولونومی دلتا است، و حالا می‌توانیم تعریف عمومی آن را

توجه کنید که در شکل بالا معنای پادساعت‌گرد هولونومی بر روی کره با معنایی که در آن مثلث دلتا را دور می‌زنیم مطابقت دارد. این حقیقت به آن دلیل است که کره انحنای مثبت دارد.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nاگر ما در عوض بردار را بر روی یک رویه با انحنای منفی جا‌به‌جا کرده بودیم، آن‌گاه چرخش بر خلاف جهت انتقال می‌شد. در این جا ما شما را به شدت تشویق می‌کنیم تا این حقیقت را با تکیه بر مشاهده بررسی کنید، با ساختن خطوط

به ضلع اول مماس نگه می‌دارد، پس وقتی که به انتهای ضلع برسد، بردار با ضلع دوم زاویه‌ی فی پایین‌نویس ۲ ایجاد می‌کند. چون این ضلع دوم نیز ژیودزیک هست، زاویه‌ی فی پایین‌نویس ۲ در طول زمانی که در امتداد آن انتقال موازی داده می‌شود، حفظ می‌شود. در نتیجه، وقتی که بردار به انتهای ضلع دوم برسد، زاویه‌ی آن با ضلع آخر برابر می‌شود با حاصل‌جمع فی پایین‌نویس ۲ و فی پایین‌نویس ۳، و این زاویه در حالی که بردار در امتداد آن لبه حرکت می‌کند حفظ می‌شود، تا در نهایت به نقطه ی شروع بردار وی برگردد، که با ضلع اولیه زاویه‌ی فی پایین‌نویس ۱ به اضافه‌ی فی پایین‌نویس ۲ به اضافه‌ی فی پایین‌نویس ۳ ایجاد می‌کند. پس،

سپس به دور مثلث دلتا دو. می‌بینیم که انتقال موازی رفت و برگشتی در امتداد ژیودزیک خط‌فاصله‌دار همدیگر را خنثی می‌کنند، و بنابراین مجموع دو هولونومی مثلث‌های دلتا یک و دلتا دو برابر است با هولونومی مثلث

بردار مماس بر اولین ضلع مثلث دلتا یک به دور مثلث دلتا یک به طور موازی انتقال داده می‌شود، که در بازگشت به خانه به اندازه‌ی هولونومی دلتا یک چرخانده شده است. سپس بردار مماس وی به دور مثلث دلتا دو انتقال موازی داده می‌شود، که در بازگشت به خانه به اندازه‌ی هولونومی دلتا دو چرخیده شده است. پس چرخش کل بعد از انتقال همرو به دور هر دو مثلث دلتا یک و دو برابر است با مجموع هولونومی دلتا یک و هولونومی دلتا دو.\n\n<br>\n\nاما به دلیل این‌که ضلع آخر مثلث دلتا یک (که در نقطه‌ی کیو شروع می‌شود) همچنین اولین ضلع مثلث دلتا دو است (که در نقطه‌ی کیو خاتمه پیدا می‌کند)، ما بردار را در امتداد ژیودزیک خط‌فاصله‌دار دوبار انتقال موازی می‌دهیم، به طور متوالی، در جهت‌های مخالف، که بنابراین بردار بدون تغییر به نقطه‌ی کیو باز می‌گردد. پس انتقال موازی یک بردار به دور مثلث دلتا یک و سپس مثلث دلتا دو به طور دنباله‌ای  معادل است با انتقال موازی آن به دور مثلث دلتا، همان طور که نشان داده شد.\n\n<br>\n\nبه این معنی که، انتقال موازی رفت و برگشتی در امتداد یک خم خنثی‌کننده است، حتی اگر آن خم ژیودزیک

با هولونومی حلقه را فرض خواهیم کرد، که در آن هولونومی یک حلقه انحنای کل درونش را اندازه‌گیری می‌کند.\n\n<br>\n\nپیش از این که اثبات را شروع کنیم، مشاهده‌ای مهم انجام می‌دهیم: همان طوری که در ابتدا از

بالا‌نویس، این رابطه‌ها به شکل زیر نوشته می‌شوند:\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nF_ab = nabla_a A_b - nabla_b A_a\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nبا آزادی\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nA_a mapsto A_a + nabla_a Theta\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nاین آزادی پیمانه‌ای در پتانسیل الکترومغناطیسی به ما می‌گوید که شکل تفاضلی آ مقداری نیست که بشود آن را به طور محلی اندازه‌گیری نمود. هیچ آزمایشی نمی‌تواند وجود داشته باشد که مقدار شکل تفاضلی آ را در نقطه‌ای به دست آورد، زیرا مجموع شکل تفاضلی آ و مشتق بیرونی میدان نرده‌ای تتا به طور دقیق همان نقش فیزیکی را ایفا می‌کنند که شکل تفاضلی آ به تنهایی بازی می‌کند. اما پتانسیل، کلیدی ریاضی برای روشی فراهم می‌کند که به وسیله‌ی آن میدان ماکسول با موجودیت فیزیکی دیگری به نام سای تعامل می‌کند. این روش چگونه کار می‌کند؟ نقش ویژه‌ی پتانسیل برداری آ این است که ما را به یک اتصال پیمانه‌ای مجهز می‌کند (یا اتصال کلافی).\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nnabla_a = fracpartialpartial x^a - ieA_a\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nکه نماد ای یک عدد حقیقی خاص است که بار الکتریکی را مقداردهی می‌کند، که توسط موجودیت سای توصیف می‌شود. در واقع، این نهاد به طور کلی یک ذره‌ی کوانتومی باردار خواهد بود، از جمله یک الکترون یا پروتون، و تابع سای، تابع موج مکانیک کوانتومی ذره می‌شود. برای معنی تمام این عبارت‌ها بنگرید به مبحث فصل ۲۱ام کتاب راه رسیدن به واقعیت نوشته‌ی آقای راجر پنروز، جایی که در آن که مفهوم تابع موج توضیح داده شده‌است. تمام چیزی که حالا باید درباره‌ی آن بدانیم این است که تابع سای سطح مقطعی از یک کلاف تاری می‌باشد، برای تعریف سطح مقطع کلاف تاری بخش سوم فصل ۱۵ کتاب پنرز را ببینید، یک کلاف که میدان‌های باردار را توصیف می‌کند، و این کلاف است که بر روی آن اتصال نابلا به عنوان یک ارتباط عمل می‌کند (برای تعریف این کلاف تاری بخش هشتم فصل ۱۵ کتاب پنروز را ببینید.)\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: 37)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nتشبیه شیلنگ آب. وقتی که در مقیاس درشت به آن نگاه شود، شیلنگ

عادی قابل مشاهده نباشد.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nمقادیر میدان الکترومغناطیسی اف و آ باردار نیستند (مقدار ای برای آن‌ها برابر با صفر است)، بنابراین همه‌ی معادلات ماکسول پس از این تعریف جدید برای نابلا پایین‌نویس آ تغییر نمی‌کنند. یعنی هنوز در آن معادلات داریم نابلا زیرنبشت آ برابر است با مشتق جزیی نسبت به ایکس بالانویس آ، در مختصات تخت مینکافسکی ـ یا در مختصات فضازمان خمیده در صورتی که به طور مناسب تعمیم داده شود. طبیعت هندسی کلاف چیست که این اتصال بر روی آن عمل می‌کند؟ یک دیدگاه ممکن است به این کلاف طوری نگاه کند که تارهایی از شکل دایره بر روی فضازمان ام داشته باشد، که این دایره یک ضریب فاز را برای تابع موج توصیف می‌کند. (این همانگونه چیزی است که در تصویر کالوزا-کلاین که در شکل بالا به آن اشاره شد، اما در آن مورد کل کلاف به عنوان فضازمان شناخته می‌شود.) بهتر است به کلاف، به عنوان کلاف برداری مقدارهای ممکن تابع سای در هر نقطه فکر کنیم، به طوری که آزادی ضرب کردن فاز، کلاف را به یک کلاف یو(۱) بر روی فضازمان ام تبدیل می‌کند. برای معنی پیدا کردن، تابع موج سای باید یک میدان مختلط باشد که تعبیر فیزیکی آن، به طور مناسبی، نسبت به جایگزینی نگاشت زیر حساس نباشد (که در این‌جا تتا یک میدان حقیقی بر خمینه‌ی ام است).\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nPsi mapsto e^itheta Psi\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nاز این جایگزینی با عنوان تبدیل پیمانه‌ای الکترومغناطیسی یاد می‌شود، و این حقیقت که تعبیر فیزیکی نسبت به این جایگزینی غیر حساس است پایایی پیمانه‌ای نامیده می‌شود. پس انحنای اتصال کلاف ما می‌شود تانسور میدان ماکسول، اف پایین‌نویس آ پایین‌نویس ب:\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nF_ab\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nپیش از این که با این ایده‌ها کاوش کنیم، بهتر است که چند نکته‌ی تاریخی را بیان کنیم. مدت کوتاهی پس از این که انیشتین نظریه‌ی نسبیت عام خود را در سال ۱۲۹۳ شمسی معرفی کرد، وایل در سال ۱۲۹۶ یک تعمیم پیشنهاد داد که در آن مفهوم واژه‌ی طول وابسته به مسیر می‌شود. (هرمان وایل، متولد ۱۲۶۳ وفات ۱۳۳۳، یک چهره‌ی مهم ریاضی در قرن بیستم بود. در حقیقت، در میان کارهای آن ریاضی دانانی که به طور تمام در قرن بیستم مشغول به نوشتن بودند، کار او در ذهن من تاثیرگذارترین بود. و او نه تنها به عنوان یک ریاضی دان محض مهم بود، بلکه همچنین به عنوان یک فیزیک دان.) در نظریه‌ی وایل، مخروط‌های پوچ نقش بنیادی خود را که در نظریه‌ی انیشتین دارند حفظ می‌کنند (برای مثال برای تعریف کردن سرعت‌های محدود کننده برای ذرات دارای جرم و فراهم کردن گروه لورنتس محلی که در همسایگی هر نقطه عمل می‌کند)، پس یک متریک به نام جی از گونه‌ی لورنتس (برای مثال +−−−) هنوز به طور محلی به هدف تعریف کردن آن مخروط‌ها مورد نیاز است. اما، هیچ مقیاس مطلقی برای اندازه‌گیری زمان یا فضا وجود ندارد، پس در طرح وایل، متریک فقط به تناسب داده می‌شود. بنابراین، تبدیل‌هایی به شکل\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\ng mapsto lambda g\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nبه ازای یک تابع نرده‌ای لاندا بر روی فضازمان ام قابل قبول هستند، این تبدیل‌ها مخروط‌های پوچ ام را دستخوش تغییر نمی‌کنند. (از این تبدیل‌ها با عنوان تجانس همشکل متریک جی یاد می‌شود. در نظریه‌ی وایل، هر انتخاب متریک جی به ما یک پیمانه‌ی ممکن می‌دهد که با آن فاصله‌ها و زمان‌ها را می‌توان اندازه‌گیری نمود.) علی رغم اینکه ممکن است وایل فاصله‌های فضایی را بیشتر مدنظر داشته است، برای ما مناسب‌تر است که در قالب اندازه‌گیری زمان فکر کنیم. (مطابق دیدگاه فصل ۱۷ کتاب پنروز). پس، در هندسه‌ی وایل، ساعت‌های ایده‌آل مطلق وجود ندارند. آهنگی که یک ساعت با آن زمان را اندازه‌گیری می‌کند به تاریخچه‌ی آن ساعت بستگی پیدا می‌کند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: 38)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nالف) نابرابری مثلث اقلیدسی: حاصل‌جمع آ-ب و ب-ث بزرگ‌تر مساوی آ-ث، که تنها در حالت تبهگنی تساوی برقرار می‌شود، وقتی که نقطه‌های آ، ب، ث در راستای یک خط قرار داشته باشند.\nب) در هندسه‌ی لورنتس، با خط‌های آ-ب، ب-ث، آ-ث همگی شبه‌زمانی آینده، این نابرابری معکوس می‌شود: حاصل‌جمع آ-ب و ب-ث کوچک‌تر مساوی آ-ث، که فقط وقتی تساوی برقرار می‌شود که آ، ب، ث همگی روی خط دنیایی یک ذره‌ی اینرسی باشند. این تناقض ساعت نسبیت خاص را نمایش می‌دهد که در آن یک مسافر فضایی با خط دنیایی آ-ب-ث بازه‌ی زمانی کوتاه‌تری را نسبت به ساکنین زمین آ-ث تجربه می‌کند.\nث) هموار کردن گوشه‌های یک مثلث اقلیدسی تفاوتی در طول لبه‌ها ایجاد نمی‌کند، و مسیر مستقیم هنوز کوتاه‌ترین است.\nد) به همین شکل، محدود کردن شتاب‌ها (با هموار کردن گوشه‌ها) تفاوتی در زمان‌ها ایجاد نمی‌کند، و مسیر (لختی) مستقیم هنوز بلندترین است.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nاین وضعیت بدتر از آنچه که در تناقض ساعت استاندارد مطرح کردیم است، که در شکل بالا توصیف کردم. در هندسه‌ی وایل، می‌توانیم یک مسافر فضایی را تصور کنیم که به ستاره‌ای دوردست سفر می‌کند و بعد به زمین باز می‌گردد تا ببیند که نه تنها آنانی که روی زمین هستند خیلی بیشتر پیر شده‌اند، بلکه ساعت‌هایی که روی زمین وجود دارند نیز با آهنگی متفاوت با ساعت‌های سفینه‌ی موشکی کار می‌کنند! در شکل پایین قسمت الف را ببینید. با استفاده از این ایده تعجب برانگیز، وایل توانست معادلات نظریه‌ی الکترومغناطیس ماکسول را در هندسه‌ی فضازمان ادغام کند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: 39)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nدر نظریه‌ی اصلی وایل درباره‌ی الکترومغناطیس، مفهوم بازه‌ی زمانی (یا بازه‌ی فضایی) مطلق نیست و به مسیر پیموده شده وابسته است. الف) یک مقایسه با تناقض ساعت که در شکل پیشین نمایش داده شد. در نظریه‌ی وایل در می‌یابیم هنگامی که مسافر فضایی به خانه می‌رسد (خط دنیایی آ-ب-ث) متوجه می‌شود که نه تنها ساعت‌های زمین (خط مستقیم آ-ث) و ساعت‌های سفینه‌ی موشکی مقدارهای متفاوتی را اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند، بلکه آهنگ تیک‌تاک کردن آن‌ها نیز متفاوت است!\nب) انحنای پیمانه‌ای وایل (که میدان ماکسول به نام اف را به دست می‌دهد) از این تغییر مقیاس زمانی همشکل به وجود می‌آید، وقتی که به دور یک حلقه‌ی بینهایت کوچک حرکت کنیم.

(این موضوع می‌تواند با کلاف تحت کرنش ب روی مجموعه‌ی اعداد مختلط که در بالا بررسی شد، مقایسه شود. شکل بعدی را ببینید. مفهوم پایه‌ای کلاف بسیار مشابه است.)\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: 41)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nمی‌توانیم یک کشش مختلط اعمال کنیم، مانند ضرب کردن در یک فاز مختلط (اکسپوننت حاصل‌ضرب آی در تتا، که تتا عددی حقیقی است)، تا گروه تقارنی کلاف برابر با یو(۱) شود، یک گروه ضربی از این اعداد مختلط.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nوقتی که انیشتین از این نظریه آگاه شد، به وایل اطلاع داد که با وجود زیبایی ریاضیاتی ایده‌های وایل، یک انتقاد فیزیکی بنیادی نسبت به آن دارد. برای مثال، به نظر می‌رسد بسامدهای طیفی در اثر تاریخچه‌ی یک اتم به طور کامل بدون تغییر باقی می‌مانند، در حالی که نظریه‌ی وایل خلاف آن را پیش‌بینی می‌کند. به طور بنیادی‌تر، با اینکه همه‌ی قوانین مکانیک کوانتومی مرتبط به طور موفقیت آمیز در آن زمان فرمول‌بندی نشده بودند، (بنگرید به فصل ۲۱ قسمت ۴ و بخش‌های ۷ و ۸ فصل ۲۳ کتاب پنروز) نظریه‌ی وایل در تضاد است با هویت لزوما دقیق در میان ذرات همنوع مختلف (فصل ۲۱ قسمت ۴ در کتاب پنروز را ببینید). به طور ویژه، یک رابطه‌ی مستقیم میان آهنگ ساعت‌ها و جرم ذرات وجود دارد. همان گونه که بعد خواهیم دید، یک ذره دارای جرم حالت سکون ام، یک فرکانس طبیعی برابر با حاصل‌ضرب ام در مجذور سی در معکوس ایچ دارد، که ایچ ثابت پلانک نامیده می‌شود و سی سرعت نور است. \n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nf = mc^2 h^-1\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nپس، در هندسه‌ی وایل، تنها آهنگ ساعت‌ها نیستند که به گذشته‌ی ذره بستگی دارند، بلکه جرم ذره نیز به تاریخچه‌ی آن وابسته خواهد بود. به این ترتیب، دو پروتون، اگر دارای گذشته‌هایی متفاوتی باشند، به طور تقریبی به یقین جرم‌های متفاوتی دارند، طبق نظریه‌ی وایل، که این اصل مکانیک کوانتومی را نقض می‌کند که ذرات همنوع باید به طور دقیق مشابه باشند (قسمت‌های ۷ و ۸ فصل ۲۳ کتاب پنروز را ببینید.)\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nبا وجود این که این یک مشاهده‌ی محکوم کننده بود، در ارتباط با ویرایش اصلی نظریه‌ی وایل، بعد معلوم شد که همان ایده کار می‌کند به شرطی که پیمانه‌ی او به مقیاس‌گذاری حقیقی اشاره نکند (توسط لاندا)، بلکه به مقیاس گذاری به وسیله‌ی یک عدد مختلط با اندازه‌ی واحد اشاره کند (اکسپوننت حاصل‌ضرب آی در تتا). این کار شاید ایده‌ی عجیبی به نظر آید، اما قانون‌های مکانیک کوانتومی ما را مجبور می‌کنند تا از اعداد مختلط در توصیف حالت یک سامانه استفاده کنیم (به طور ویژه بخش‌های ۶ و ۹ فصل ۲۱ پنروز را ببینید). به طور خاص، یک عدد مختلط با طول واحد وجود دارد که می‌تواند بدون عواقب قابل مشاهده و به طور محلی در این حالت کوانتومی ضرب شود، این حالت اغلب تابع موج سای نامیده می‌شود. این تعویض غیر قابل مشاهده که تابع سای را به حاصل‌ضرب سای و اکسپوننت آی در تتا نگاشت می‌کند، امروزه هنوز با عنوان تبدیل پیمانه‌ای شناخته می‌شود حتی با اینکه هیچ تغییری در مقیاس طول را شامل نمی‌شود، تغییری که چرخش در صفحه‌ی مختلط است (یک صفحه‌ی مختلط بدون ارتباط مستقیمی با ابعاد فضا یا زمان). در این شکل پیچیده‌ی عجیب، ایده‌ی وایل تنظیمات فیزیکی مناسبی را برای یک اتصال از نوع گروه تقارنی یو(۱) فراهم آورد، و الان این پایه‌ی تصویر جدید چگونگی تعامل میدان الکترومغناطیسی در واقعیت را تشکیل می‌دهد. عملگر نابلا که در بالا با استفاده از پتانسیل الکترومغناطیسی تعریف شد\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nnabla_a = fracpartialpartial x^a - ieA_a\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nیک اتصال کلاف یو(۱) را بر روی کلاف توابع موج کوانتومی سای ارایه می‌کند.

پرده قابل دسترسی نیستند با این وجود که تنها با یک شکاف یا دیگری می‌توانند قابل دسترسی باشند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nجالب است که وابستگی به مسیر این اتصال (که می‌توانیم آن را با وابستگی به مسیر نمایش داده شده در شکل بالا در کلاف خطی کرنش داده‌شده‌ی بی مقایسه کنیم) به طور برجسته‌ای در انواعی از شرایط تجربی معینی پدیدار می‌شود، که پدیده‌ای به نام اثر اهارونوف-بوهم را نشان می‌دهد. به خاطر این که اتصال نابلای ما فقط در سطح پدیده‌های کوانتومی عمل می‌کند، ما این وابستگی به مسیر را در آزمایش‌های کلاسیک نمی‌بینیم. در عوض، اثر اهارونوف-بوهم به تداخل کوانتومی وابسته است (بخش ۴ فصل ۲۱ پنروز و شکل بالا را ببینید). در مشهورترین نسخه، الکترون‌ها جوری نشانه‌گیری می‌شوند تا از دو ناحیه‌ی عاری از میدان الکترومغناطیسی عبور کنند (اف برابر با صفر)، اما با این شرط که با استفاده از یک سولنویید استوانه‌ای بلند جدا شده باشند (که حاوی خط‌های مغناطیسی نیرو هست)، تا به یک پرده‌ی تشخیص‌دهنده در پشت برسند (قسمت الف شکل زیر را ببینید). در هیچ مقطعی الکترون‌ها با میدان اف غیر صفر مواجه نمی‌شوند. با این حال، ناحیه‌ی عاری از میدان به نام آر (آغاز از منبع، دو نیم شدن به صورتی که از هر دو طرف سولنویید عبور کنند، و در پرده دوباره با یکدیگر جمع شوند) یک ناحیه‌ی ساده به هم وصل شده نیست، و میدان اف بیرون از ناحیه‌ی آر به طوری است که هیچ انتخاب پیمانه‌ای وجود ندارد که پتانسیل آ را در همه جا در ناحیه‌ی آر از بین ببرد. حضور این پتانسیل غیر صفر در ناحیه‌ی غیر ساده متصل شده آر ـ یا به طور صحیح‌تر، وابسته به مسیر بودن اتصال نابلا در ناحیه آر ـ به جابجایی در لبه‌های تداخلی در پرده منجر می‌شود. \n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n(Image: 43)\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nاثر اهاروناف-بوهم. الف) یک پرتوی الکترونی به دو مسیر تقسیم می‌شود که به دو سمت مجموعه‌ای از خط‌های شار مغناطیسی می‌روند (که به وسیله‌ی یک سولنویید بلند ممکن شده است). پرتوها در یک پرده به یکدیگر آورده می‌شوند، و الگوی تداخل کوانتومی حاصل (با شکل پیشین مقایسه شود) به شدت شار مغناطیسی وابسته است ـ علی‌رغم اینکه الکترون‌ها فقط با یک میدان با شدت صفر روبرو می‌شوند (میدان اف برابر است با صفر).\nب) این اثر به مقدار انتگرال حلقه‌ی آ بستگی دارد، که می‌تواند روی مسیر بسته‌ی غیربدیهی از نظر توپولوژیکی مقداری غیر صفر داشته باشد با اینکه میدان اف روی این مسیر برابر است با صفر. مقدار انتگرال بسته‌ی آ تحت تغییر شکل پیوسته‌ی مسیر در ناحیه‌ی عاری از میدان بدون تغییر باقی می‌ماند.\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nدر واقع، اثر جابجایی لبه‌ای به هیچ مقدار محلی که اتصال آ ممکن است داشته باشد بستگی ندارد (که نمی‌تواند، زیرا اتصال آ به طور محلی قابل مشاهده شدن نیست، همان طوری که در بالا گفتیم) اما به انتگرال غیر محلی معینی از اتصال آ بستگی دارد. این مقدار انتگرال بسته‌ی اتصال آ است، که در امتداد یک حلقه‌ی توپولوژیکی غیر بدیهی درون ناحیه‌ی آر گرفته می‌شود. بخش ب شکل بالا را ببینید. به این دلیل که مشتق بیرونی اتصال آ درون ناحیه‌ی آر صفر می‌شود (به خاطر این که میدان اف در ناحیه آر برار با صفر است)، اگر حلقه‌ی بسته در ناحیه‌ی آر را به طور پیوسته حرکت دهیم انتگرال حلقه‌ی بسته‌ی اتصال آ تغییری نمی‌کند. این روشن می‌کند که غیر صفر بودن انتگرال بسته‌ی شکل تفاضلی آ، درون ناحیه‌ای عاری از میدان، و در نتیجه خود اثر اهارونوف-بوهم، به این بستگی دارد که این ناحیه‌ی عاری از میدان به طور توپولوژیکی غیر بدیهی باشد.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nبه دلیل خاستگاه تاریخی در ایده‌ی چشمگیر وایل (که در اصل نقشی به عنوان پیمانه کردن وابسته به مسیر بازی کرد)، ما به این اتصال الکترومغناطیسی نابلا یک اتصال پیمانه‌ای می‌گوییم ـ و این نام همچنین برای تعمیم دادن الکترومغناطیس، با عنوان نظریه‌ی یانگ ـ میلز، به کار برده می‌شود، که در توصیف تعاملات ضعیف و قوی در فیزیک ذرات جدید استفاده می‌شود. به این نکته توجه می‌کنیم که ایده‌ی اتصال پیمانه‌ای به وجود داشتن یک تقارن وابسته است (که برای الکترومغناطیس تقارن  به صورت زیر است:)\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\nPsi mapsto e^itheta Psi\n\n<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nکه باید دقیق باشد و به طور مستقیم قابل مشاهده کردن نباشد. ما انتقاد انیشتین به ایده‌ی پیمانه اصلی وایل را به یاد می‌آوریم، که در آن جرم یک ذره (و بنابراین فرکانس طبیعی آن) به طور مستقیم قابل اندازه گیری است، و پس نمی‌تواند به عنوان یک میدان پیمانه‌ای به این معنی مورد نیاز استفاده شود. ما بعد خواهیم دید که در بعضی از کاربردهای جدید ایده‌ی پیمانه این مساله به طور واضحی گل آلود می شود.\n\n</p>\n</div>","category":"section"},{"location":"maxwellfield_persian.html#References","page":"The Maxwell Field
