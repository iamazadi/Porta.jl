It is the geometrical shape that relates Einstein's spacetime to quantum fields. In this model, we visualize the Hopf fibration by first computing its points via a bundle atlas and then rendering the points in 3D space via stereographic projection. The projection step is necessary because the Hopf fibration is embedded in a four-space. Yet, it has only three degrees of freedom as a three-dimensional shape. The idea that makes this model more special and interesting than a typical visualization is the idea of Planet Hopf, due to Dror Bar-Natan (2010). The basic idea is that since the Hopf map takes the three-dimensional sphere into the two-dimensional sphere, we can pull the skin of the globe back to the three-sphere and visualize it.","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"Into the bargain, the Earth rotates about its axis every 24 hours. That spinning transformation of the Earth, together with the non-trivial product space of the Hopf bundle, can be encoded naturally into a monolithic visualization. It also makes sense to visualize differential operators in the Minkowski space-time as vectors in a cross-section of the Hopf bundle and then study the properties of spin-transformations. The choice of a gauge transformation (or trivialization) along with Lorentz transformations of Minkowski spacetime should not have any effect on physical laws. It is therefore a great model to understand these transformations and walk the road to reality. The following explains how the source code for generating animations of the Hopf fibration works (alternative views of Planet Hopf). We follow the beginning of chapter 4 of Mark J.D. Hamilton (2018) for a formal definition of the Hopf fibration as a fiber bundle. The book Mathematical Gauge Theory explains the Standard Model to students of both mathematics and physics, covers both the specific gauge theory of the Standard Model and generalizations, and is highly accessible and self-contained. Then, the definitions are going to be used to explain the source code in terms of computational methods and types.","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"(Image: image1) (Image: board2) (Image: image2)","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"First, let E and M be smooth manifolds.

Because ζ is a union of complex numbers and the singleton of infinity (of type Union{Complex, ComplexF64, Float64}). For an inhomogeneous coordinate system we treat the point at infinity in a different way. For example, for all values of w, if ζ equals infinity then the rotation component of a four-screw should not have any effect on the north pole. But, multiplying positive infinity by a complex number of negative magnitude makes ζ equal to negative infinity, which is not in Argand plane. In that case, we first check the edge case to leave ζ unchanged whenever its value is infinity, ζ = s.ζ. No amount of z-boost and rotation about the z-axis should transform the north pole.

(Persian)","title":"The Unicycle (Persian)","text":"<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<p>\n\nرباتی که در اینجا می‌سازیم، یک ربات تعادلی تک چرخ است. همان‌طور که از نام آن پیداست، این ربات تنها دارای یک چرخ بوده و بنابراین یک نقطه‌ی تماس با زمین دارد. به همین دلیل پیچیدگی آن بیشتر از ربات‌های تعادلی دوچرخ است. در حقیقت این ربات باید تعادل خود را در دو راستا و حول دو محور حفظ کند. در این ربات حرکت به جلو و عقب و حفظ تعادل در این جهت‌ها همانند یک ربات تعادلی دوچرخ است و بر پایه‌ی همان اصول فیزیکی استوار است. اما با توجه به این که چرخ ربات هیچ حرکتی در جهت‌های چپ و راست ندارد، برای حفظ کردن تعادل در این راستا باید از مولد گشتاور دیگری استفاده شود. به این منظور از یک جرم چرخان که به طور معمول چرخ عکس‌العملی خوانده می‌شود کمک می‌گیریم. اصول عملکرد این جرم چرخان که در قسمت بالای ربات نصب شده است، به این صورت است که اگر به آن گشتاوری وارد کنیم تا به چرخش درآید، آن جرم نیز گشتاوری که از نظر اندازه برابر با گشتاور وارد شده است به عنوان عکس‌العمل بر ربات وارد می‌کند. یکی از اصل‌های فیزیکی به نام پایستگی اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی این رخداد را توجیه می‌کند. طبق این اصل، مجموع اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی یک مجموعه به دور یک محور مشخص بدون تغییر باقی می‌ماند، مگر آنکه یک گشتاور خارجی به آن وارد شود. بنابراین اگر یکی از اجزای این مجموعه در اثر گشتاور داخلی شروع به چرخش کند، بقیه‌ی اجزای مجموعه با چرخش در جهت عکس، تاثیر آن را خنثی می‌کنند. در غیر این صورت اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی پایسته نخواهد ماند. با کمک این گشتاور عکس‌العمل می‌توانیم زاویه‌ی ربات را به دو طرف چپ یا راست تحت کنترل بگیریم.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nربات تعادلی تک چرخ ممکن است چندان کاربردی به نظر نیاید، اما همانند ربات تعادلی دوچرخ، یا انواع پاندول‌های معکوس، شرایط مناسبی را برای آزمایش کردن و بررسی الگوریتم‌های مختلف کنترلی فراهم می‌کند. علاوه‌براین، مهم‌ترین جزء این ربات که چرخ عکس‌العملی آن است کاربرد خاصی در ماهواره‌ها دارد. پس از آنکه یک ماهواره در مدار زمین قرار داده شد، تنها نیروی وارد شونده بر آن نیروی جاذبه است. بنابراین کنترلی بر حرکت خود نخواهد داشت. برای آنکه ماهواره بتواند در مسیر حرکت خود مانورهای کوچکی داشته باشد، یا آنکه مدار خود را به اندازه‌ی کوچکی اصلاح کند، به طور معمول آن را حداقل به یکی از سه سیستم محرکه مجهز می‌کنند: موشک پیش‌راننده، گشتاور دهنده‌ی مغناطیسی، یا چرخ عکس‌العملی. مورد اول خارج از بحث ماست. نحوه‌ی به کار گیری چرخ عکس‌العملی در ماهواره به این صورت است که ماهواره می‌تواند برای جهت‌گیری به یک سمت معین، چرخ داخلی خود را در جهت عکس به مقدار لازم بچرخاند. میزان این چرخش بر اساس نسبت ممان اینرسی دورانی ماهواره و چرخ تعیین می‌شود. برای کنترل چرخش ماهواره در تمامی جهت‌ها لازم است ماهواره به سه چرخ که روی محورهای عمود بر هم نصب شده‌اند مجهز باشد. موتورسواران حرفه‌ای نیز از این خاصیت پایستگی اندازه‌ی حرکت دورانی بهره می‌گیرند. هنگامی که یک موتورسوار پرش کرده و از زمین جدا می‌شود، تنها نیروی وارد شونده به آن جاذبه‌ی زمین است که خارج از کنترل موتورسوار می‌باشد. در این وضعیت، موتورسوار با افزایش دادن سرعت چرخ عقب خود یا کاهش دادن آن (ترمز گرفتن) می‌تواند زاویه‌ی فرود خود را تنظیم کند. تاثیر گشتاور عکس‌العمل که از چرخ عقب به بدنه‌ی موتور وارد می‌شود، کل مجموعه را به سمت بالا یا پایین می‌چرخاند. برای ساختن این ربات لازم است با ساختار مکانیکی، مدل‌سازی ریاضی، الگوریتم‌های کنترلی، و مدارهای الکترونیکی آن آشنا شوید.\n\n</p>\n</div>","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle_persian.html","page":"The Unicycle (Persian)","title":"The Unicycle (Persian)","text":"<div dir = \"rtl\">\n<h2>\n\nسیستم سنجش موقعیت بر پایه‌ی اینرسی\n\n</h2>\n<p>\n\nکنترل و ناوبری یک ربات متحرک بدون دانستن موقعیت آن میسر نیست. بدین منظور سنسورهای گوناگونی طراحی و ساخته شده‌اند که هر یک با توجه به کاربرد خاص خود به کار گرفته می‌شوند. از جمله انواع سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یابی می‌توان شتاب‌سنج‌های دقیق مورد استفاده در موشک‌ها، ژیروسکوپ‌های موجود در ماشین‌های پرنده، ارتفاع‌سنج‌ها، سیستم‌های جهت‌یابی بر اساس میدان مغناطیسی زمین، سیستم‌های موقعیت یابی بر پایه‌ی سامانه‌ی موقعیت‌یاب جهانی، سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یابی به وسیله‌ی شبکه‌های بیسیم الکترومغناطیسی یا صوتی، و حتی سیستم‌های بسیار پیچیده‌ی موقعیت‌یابی بر پایه‌ی تصویر ستارگان که در ماهواره‌ها و فضاپیماها مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد، را نام برد.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nامروزه حس‌گرهای الکترومکانیکی در ابعاد بسیار کوچک (میکرومتری) ساخته می‌شوند. این فناوری با نام سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی شناخته می‌شود. ظهور فناوری سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی تاثیر شگرفی در کاهش اندازه و قیمت انواع سنسورهای الکترومکانیکی و افزایش دقت آن‌ها داشته است. این مساله امکان استفاده از چندین سنسور را در یک ربات کوچک فراهم می‌کند. حتی در برخی موارد، سازندگان چندین سنسور موقعیت‌یاب (مانند شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ) را در قالب یک تراشه‌ی واحد عرضه می‌کنند.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nاز میان ادوات موقعیت‌یابی، سنسورهای اندازه‌گیری شتاب، سرعت دورانی (ژیروسکوپ)، و میدان مغناطیسی از پرکاربردترین لوازم به کار گرفته شده در ربات‌های خودگردان کوچک می‌باشند. تمرکز این بخش بر ماژول شتاب‌سنج و ماژول ژیروسکوپ است. با استفاده از شتاب‌سنج می‌توانید شتاب حرکت ربات و همچنین سرعت و موقعیت آن را (از طریق انتگرال‌گیری) محاسبه کنید. لازم است بدانید که شتاب جاذبه‌ی زمین نیز در اندازه‌گیری یک شتاب‌سنج تاثیر می‌گذارد. این مساله موقعیت‌یابی را دشوار می‌سازد، اما برای اندازه‌گیری انحراف نسبت به مسیر جاذبه (خط عمود) سودمند است. ژیروسکوپ نیز به طور اساسی سرعت زاویه‌ای را اندازه‌گیری می‌کند که با انتگرال‌گیری، موقعیت زاویه‌ای (جهت) نیز قابل محاسبه خواهد بود. بدین ترتیب با کمک شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ امکان اندازه‌گیری موقعیت و جهت ربات متحرک شما و به طور مخصوص سنجش میزان انحراف آن نسبت به خط عمود (راستای جاذبه) فراهم است.\n\n</p>\n<h3>\n\nشتاب‌سنج\n\n</h3>\n<p>\n\nتمامی شتاب‌سنج‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی به شیوه‌ای دربرگیرنده‌ی یک جرم متحرک داخلی هستند که تحت تاثیر نیروی خارجی به حرکت درمی‌آید. این جرم توسط یک ساختار فنر مانند در جای خود نگه داشته می‌شود و میزان جابجایی آن در اثر نیروی خارجی وارد شده، توسط روش‌های متفاوتی مانند تغییر اثر خازنی اندازه‌گیری می‌شود. سپس با دانستن ثابت استحکام سازه فنری و میزان جرم متحرک، این جابجایی به معادل شتاب آن تبدیل می‌شود. با توجه به این توضیحات، شتاب‌سنج‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی به طور ذاتی نیروی خارجی وارد شده بر جرم متحرک را اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند. به همین علت، تمامی این نوع شتاب‌سنج‌ها شتاب استاتیک (جاذبه‌ی زمین) و شتاب دینامیک (ناشی از تغییرات سرعت) را به یک شکل اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند و تفکیک کردن این دو مقدار اندازه‌گیری شده بیانگر شتاب ناشی از حرکت به علاوه شتاب جاذبه می‌باشد، و اگر راستای اندازه‌گیری حسگر در جهت افقی (عمود بر جاذبه‌ی زمین) باشد، تنها شتاب دینامیک سنجیده می‌شود و جاذبه تاثیری بر اندازه‌گیری نخواهد داشت. پس در صورتی که در یک سیستم از یک شتاب‌سنج تک محوره (با قابلیت اندازه‌گیری در یکی از جهت‌های مختصات) استفاده می‌شود، لازم است زاویه‌ی قرارگیری آن نسبت به راستای جاذبه مشخص باشد تا تاثیر شتاب استاتیک قابل محاسبه باشد.\n\n</p>‌\n<p>\n\nحال تصور کنید دو یا سه شتاب‌سنج در اختیار دارید که راستای اندازه‌گیری آن‌ها دو-به-دو نسبت به هم عمود است (مانند محورهای مختصات ایکس، ایگرگ و زد در دستگاه استاندارد دکارتی). اگر سرعت حرکت این مجموعه ثابت باشد و تنها شتاب استاتیک ناشی از جاذبه به آن وارد شود، با مقایسه‌ی نسبت شتاب اندازه‌گیری شده توسط هر یک از محورها، زاویه‌ی قرارگیری این مجموعه نسبت به راستای جاذبه قابل محاسبه است. این روشی است که در بسیاری از ترازهای الکترونیکی و ربات‌های متحرک برای سنجش زاویه‌ی قرارگیری نسبت به راستای جاذبه مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد.\n\n</p>\n</div>","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle_persian.html","page":"The Unicycle (Persian)","title":"The Unicycle (Persian)","text":"<div dir =

توجه قرار گیرند، حساسیت به تغییرات دما و ولتاژ تغذیه، و وجود آفست اولیه (مقدار خوانده شده در شتاب صفر) است که باید با کالیبراسیون برطرف گردد.\n\n</p>\n<h3>\n\nژیروسکوپ\n\n</h3>\n<p>\n\nهمانطور که می‌دانید، یک ژیروسکوپ به طور اساسی سرعت دورانی به دور یک محور را اندازه‌گیری می‌کند. بدین صورت که چرخش حول یک محور با مقدار مشخصی (به طور غالب در واحد درجه بر ثانیه) اندازه‌گیری شده و چرخش در خلاف جهت آن نتیجه‌ای با علامت عکس تولید می‌کند و در حالتی که چرخش متوقف گردد، مقدار صفر اندازه‌گیری خواهد شد. ژیروسکوپ‌های مکانیکی که اساس کارشان بر پایه‌ی نیروهای کوریولیس یک جرم چرخان استوار است، مدت‌ها در هواپیماها و موشک‌ها به کار گرفته می‌شدند تا آنکه ژیروسکوپ‌های نوری و انواع سامانه‌های میکروالکترومکانیکی ساخته شدند. از میان انواع ساخته شده، ژیروسکوپ‌های نوری دقیق‌ترین و ژیروسکوپ‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی ارزان‌ترین و پرکاربردترین انواع این وسیله‌ی اندازه‌گیری به شمار می‌آیند.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبرخلاف شتاب‌سنح، یک ژیروسکوپ به طور عمومی به لرزش حساس نیست . نتایج اندازه‌گیری یکنواخت‌تری را تولید می‌کند. اما از آنجایی که سرعت دورانی به تنهایی کاربرد چندانی ندارد، و موقعیت زاویه‌ای مدنظر بیشتر ماشین‌های متحرک است، خروجی این حسگر انتگرال‌گیری می‌شود تا موقعیت زاویه‌ای استخراج گردد. وجود انتگرال‌گیر در سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یاب بر پایه‌ی ژیروسکوپ موجب می‌شود کوچک‌ترین آفست‌ها و خطاهای دایمی که وجود آن امری اجتناب ناپذیر است با گذشت زمان روی هم جمع شده و خطای زیادی ایجاد کند. بدین ترتیب موقعیت زاویه‌ای محاسبه شده توسط انتگرال‌گیری از خروجی ژیروسکوپ، به مرور زمان از مقدار واقعی آن دور می‌شود تا جایی که پس از گذشت چند دقیقه (یا حتی چند ثانیه) مقدار محاسبه شده به هیچ عنوان معتبر نیست. این مساله ایجاب می‌کند که ژیروسکوپ‌ها به همراه حسگرهای دیگری مانند حسگرهای تشخیص جهت میدان مغناطیسی زمین و یا شتاب‌سنج به کار گرفته شوند، مگر آنکه هدف از اندازه‌گیری، تنها سرعت دوران باشد و نه موقعیت زاویه‌ای، که بدین ترتیب انتگرال‌گیر حذف شده و خروجی ژیروسکوپ دقت کافی خواهد داشت.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nژیروسکوپ‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی نیز همانند شتاب‌سنج‌های سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی در ابعاد بسیار کوچک و با قیمت مناسب ساخته می‌شوند و حتی بسیاری از سازندگان، دو یا سه ژیروسکوپ که برای اندازه‌گیری در جهت‌های مختلف در راستاهای عمود بر هم قرار گرفته‌اند، را در قالب یک تراشه‌ی الکترونیکی واحد

سه‌محوره به تنهایی می‌تواند برای سنجش جهت‌گیری نسبت به راستای جاذبه به کار گرفته شود. اما این اندازه‌گیری تنها در صورتی صحیح است که هیچ شتاب دیگری غیر از شتاب استاتیک جاذبه به سیستم وارد نشود. این مساله در ربات‌های متحرک امکان‌پذیر نیست. علاوه بر این یک شتاب‌سنج حساسیت زیادی نسبت به لرزش داشته و به دلیل نویز زیاد، اطلاعات خروجی آن به تنهایی ارزش چندانی ندارد. در مقابل، ژیروسکوپ نیز معایب خود را دارد که مهمترین آن دور شدن تدریجی زاویه‌ی محاسبه شده که از انتگرال‌گیری به دست آمده است، از مقدار واقعی است. خوشبختانه خطاهای موجود در اندازه‌گیری ژیروسکوپ و شتاب‌سنج دارای ماهیتی به طور کامل متفاوت می‌باشند، به شکلی که با به کار گرفتن درست هر دو حسگر در کنار هم می‌توان خطاهای خروجی هر دو حسگر را تصحیح کرد. برای استفاده‌ی موثر از داده‌های هر دو حسگر باید اطلاعات خروجی آن‌ها را به نحوی با یکدیگر تلفیق کرد که نتیجه‌ی حاصل شده، از هر کدام از داده‌های حسگرها به تنهایی معتبرتر باشد.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبا فرض آنکه شتاب دینامیک طولانی مدتی به سیستم شما وارد نمی‌شود و بنابراین فرض آنکه راستای جاذبه درست محاسبه شده است، می توانید بردار جاذبه‌ی زمین (که اکنون جهت آن مشخص شده است و مقدار آن نیز برابر با ۹٫۸ متر بر مجذور ثانیه در نظر گرفته شده است) را از بردار شتاب محاسبه شده توسط اطلاعات فیلتر شده شتاب‌سنج تفریق نمایید تا شتاب دینامیک حرکت شما محاسبه شود. با انتگرال‌گیری از شتاب دینامیک می‌توانید سرعت حرکت و موقعیت ربات را به دست آورید. البته این محاسبات به دلیل انتگرال‌گیری تنها در کوتاه‌مدت معتبر می‌باشند. برای جلوگیری از تجمیع خطا در طولانی‌مدت لازم است یک حسگر موقعیت‌یاب دیگر مانند سامانه‌ی موقعیت‌یاب جهانی را به این مجموعه اضافه کنید.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nهمانطور که می‌دانید، در یک سیستم موقعیت‌یاب شامل ژیروسکوپ و شتاب‌سنج سه‌محوره (دارای ۶ درجه‌ی آزادی)، بردار جاذبه که توسط شتاب‌سنج اندازه‌گیری می‌شود همانند معیاری است که از تاثیر ناشی از انحراف تدریجی ژیروسکوپ در تخمین جهت جاذبه ممانعت می‌کند. اما این بردار در صفحه‌ی افق تصویری ندارد. علاوه بر این، با دانستن اندازه و جهت یک بردار شناخته شده (مانند بردار جاذبه) در یک دستگاه مختصات متعامد نمی‌توان راستای قرارگیری هر سه محور آن دستگاه را به طور همزمان مشخص کرد. در واقع نشان داده می‌شود که بیشمار دستگاه مختصات وجود دارد که یک بردار معین را به صورت یکسان اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند (اگر یک دستگاه مختصات را به دور محوری به موازات بردار یاد شده بچرخانید، تمامی دستگاه‌هایی که در اثر چرخش با هر زاویه‌ای حول این محور حاصل می‌شوند بردار نام برده شده را به یک صورت اندازه‌گیری می‌کنند). برای تشخیص دادن نحوه‌ی قرارگیری یک دستگاه مختصات در فضای سه‌بعدی باید نتایج اندازه‌گیری حداقل دو بردار ناموازی را در این دستگاه داشته باشیم. دستگاه مختصاتی که می‌خواهیم جهت‌گیری آن را معلوم کنیم همان واحد موقعیت‌یاب ماست. به همین علت خروجی یک الگوریتم تلفیق داده که از اطلاعات شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ سه‌محوره استفاده می‌کند، برای جهت‌یابی حول محور عمود بر سطح زمین (که همان محور زد می‌باشد) قابل استناد نیست. برای رفع کردن این مشکل لازم است از یک بردار معیار دیگر که در صفحه‌ی افقی تصویر قابل ملاحظه‌ای دارد استفاده شود. یک قطب‌نمای الکترونیکی می‌تواند این هدف را برآورده کند. سیستم‌های موقعیت‌یاب در ماشین‌های پرنده به طور عمومی از هر سه حسگر قطب‌نما، شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ (دارای ۹ درجه‌ی آزادی) بهره می‌گیرند، و الگوریتم تلفیق داده‌ی موجود در آن‌ها، اطلاعات تمامی حسگرها را پردازش می‌کند.\n\n</p>\n</div>","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle_persian.html","page":"The Unicycle (Persian)","title":"The Unicycle (Persian)","text":"(Image:

برنامه‌نویسی داده‌های مورد نیاز الگوریتم را سازمان‌دهی می‌کنیم. یک سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی دارای حداقل یک شتاب‌سنج سه‌محوره و یک ژیروسکوپ سه‌محوره می‌باشد. به کار بردن صفت «سه‌محوره» به ما این پیشنهاد را می‌دهد که به دو بردار سه عنصری نیاز داریم تا داده‌های شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ را در رایانه ذخیره کنیم. اما در واقعیت مقدار مطلق و مقیاس هر عنصر با بقیه عنصرها متفاوت است. به بیانی دیگر یک تبدیل همگرا بر روی هر بردار اندازه‌گیری شده اثر می‌کند که باید در آزمایشگاه فیزیک ضریب‌های آن را با آزمایش کردن بیابیم. در آن صورت می‌توانیم داده‌های حسگرهای مختلف درون یک سامانه‌ی میکروالکترومکانیکی را با یکدیگر هم‌تراز کنیم و در تلفیق داده‌های چندین سامانه، خطای ناشی از ساختن و نصب کردن حسگرها را کم‌تر کنیم.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبرای جبران کردن مقدار مطلق یک اندازه‌گیری و در نتیجه پیدا کردن نقطه‌ی صفر اندازه‌گیری به سه عدد برای شتاب‌سنج و سه عدد برای ژیروسکوپ نیاز داریم. برای این آزمایش باید بدنه‌ی ربات را به طور تراز بر روی صفحه‌ای صلب که خود نیز نسبت به بردار گرانش زمین تراز است، قرار دهیم. با خواندن مقدارهای خام اندازه‌گیری‌های حسگرها می‌توان یک مقدار جبران کننده از اندازه‌گیری خام کم کرد تا به اندازه‌گیری صفر رسید. این کار را برای هر محور به طور جداگانه انجام می‌دهیم. در مورد ژیروسکوپ‌های باکیفیت ساخت مطلوب، در حالت سکون به طور معمول مقدار جبران‌کننده صفر خواهد بود، در حالی که به خاطر شرایط نصب کردن شتاب‌سنج‌ها مقدار جبران‌کننده به طور تقریبی همیشه غیر صفر است.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nبرای پیدا کردن مقیاس یک شتاب‌سنج باید بدانیم که اگر یک محور شتاب‌سنج در راستای بردار گرانش قرار بگیرد، آن‌گاه مقدار مطلق محور خوانده‌شده در حالت سکون باید برابر با یک جی باشد که شتاب استاتیک در ارتفاع سطح دریاهای آزاد است. همین‌طور برای پیدا کردن مقیاس ژیروسکوپ از داده‌های سرعت زاویه‌ای انتگرال می‌گیریم و با چرخاندن بدنه‌ی ربات به اندازه‌ی زاویه‌ای مشخص، ضریب مقیاس را طوری تعیین می‌کنیم که حاصل انتگرال برابر با مقدار درست زاویه شود. تا این مرحله به ۲۴ متغیر نیاز داریم تا تنظیم کردن اندازه‌گیری یک واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی را انجام دهیم. اما به تعداد ۹ متغیر دیگر به تعریف ساختار واحد اضافه می‌کنیم تا نتیجه‌ی پردازش برآورد شیب را در آن‌ها ذخیره کنیم. این ۹ مقدار شامل زاویه‌های اویلر (غلط، تاب و سمت‌گشت) و مشتق‌های مرتبه اول و مرتبه دوم آن‌هاست.\n\n</p>\n</div>","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle_persian.html","page":"The Unicycle (Persian)","title":"The Unicycle (Persian)","text":"typedef struct\n{\n  int16_t

واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی عمومی، یک اشاره‌گر مدل سامانگر خطی درجه دوم به عنوان ورودی دریافت می‌شود. وظیفه‌ی این تابع، ابتدا به‌روزرسانی اندازه‌گیری‌های دو واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی است که به طور متوالی انجام می‌شود، و سپس برآورد شیب و تلفیق داده حسگرهاست. با صدا زدن دو تابع به‌روزرسانی واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۱ و ۲ قسمت اول وظیفه انجام می‌شود. در فرض مساله‌ی برآورد شیب مهم است که تا حد امکان به طور تقریبی این اندازه‌گیری‌ها به طور همزمان انجام شوند. اما برای برآورد شیب، بردارهای آر ۱ و آر ۲ را با استفاده از اندازه‌گیری شتاب‌سنج ساختمان‌های داده واحدهای ۱ و ۲ مقداردهی می‌کنیم. به دلیل اینکه چهارچوب مختصات حسگرها نسبت به چهارچوب بدنه‌ی ربات چرخشی ندارند، بردارهای آر در ماتریس همانی (ماتریس بی) ضرب می‌شوند و بدون تغییر به مرحله‌ی بعدی برآورد راه پیدا می‌کنند. اما طراحی الگوریتم اجازه می‌دهد تا هر واحد حسگر را به طور دلخواه در طراحی ربات نصب کرد و با مقداردهی درست ماتریس بی برای هر واحد، بردار آر آن واحد را به شکل جداگانه و مناسب چرخاند تا جزییات طراحی ربات به مرحله‌ی بعدی برآورد شیب راه پیدا نکند. در ادامه، ماتریس ام از عنصرهای بردار آر برای حسگر ۱ و بردار آر برای حسگر ۲ به صورت دو بلوک ستونی مقداردهی می‌شود. بعد ماتریس ام در ماتریس تلفیق بهینه ضرب می‌شود تا ماتریس مجهول کیو به دست آید. ضرب کردن ماتریس ام در ماتریس ایکس مهم‌ترین گام الگوریتم برآورد شیب است. زیرا که بردار گرانش را از ستون اول ماتریس کیو می‌خوانیم و سپس با تابع معکوس تانژانت زاویه‌های غلت و تاب (به ترتیب بتا و گاما) را محاسبه می‌کنیم.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر آخرین مرحله، داده‌های ژیروسکوپ و شتاب‌سنج را با یکدیگر تلفیق می‌کنیم تا اثر نویز را بر برآورد موقعیت بدنه کاهش دهیم. به منظور تلفیق داده‌های شتاب‌سنج و ژیروسکوپ، ابتدا سرعت‌های زاویه‌ای هر ژیروسکوپ (که بردار سه عنصری می‌باشد) را با استفاده از ماتریس بی می‌چرخانیم تا از مختصات حسگر به مختصات بدنه چرخانده شوند. سپس، سرعت‌های زاویه‌ای واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۱ را با سرعت‌های زاویه‌ای واحد ۲ جمع می‌کنیم و نتیجه را بر ۲ تقسیم می‌کنیم تا به میانگین هر دو واحد برسیم. بعد، ماتریس ای را تشکیل می‌دهیم که در واقع یک تابعک وابسته به زاویه‌های غلت و تاب (بتا و گاما) می‌باشد. با ضرب ماتریس-بردار ماتریس ای در بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای به بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای درست دست پیدا می‌کنیم. ضرب ماتریس-بردار ماتریس ای در بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی گام مهمی در تلفیق داده است، زیرا بسته به زاویه‌های غلت و تاب برآورده شده‌ی شتاب‌سنجی، بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی به بردار سرعت زاویه‌ای اویلری تبدیل می‌شود. با اندازه‌گیری کردن دوره‌ی به‌روزرسانی حسگرها بر حسب ثانیه، می‌توانیم اختلاف زمانی دوره را در سرعت زاویه‌ای ضرب کنیم (که ضرب عدد ثابت در تک تک عنصرهای یک بردار می‌باشد) تا به بردار زاویه مطلق برسیم.\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر پایان، یک ترکیب خطی از مقدار انتگرال‌گیری شده سرعت‌زاویه‌ای و مقدار برآورد شیب شتاب‌سنجی را به عنوان مقدار تلفیق داده شده محاسبه می‌کنیم تا به برآورد شیب کلی بهتری برسیم. این ترکیب خطی با ثابت‌های کاپا ۱ و کاپا ۲ تعیین می‌شود، به طوری که برآورد شیبی که تنها با استفاده از شتاب‌سنج به دست آمده است با برآورد شیبی که با مجموع انتگرال سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی و برآورد شیب شتاب‌سنجی در گام زمانی پیشین به دست آمده است، ترکیب می‌شود. نسبت این ترکیب خطی به گونه‌ای است که عمده‌ی برآورد شیب تلفیقی بر عهده‌ی شتاب‌سنج باشد، زیرا عمل انتگرال‌گیری از سرعت زاویه‌ای ژیروسکوپی خطای اندازه‌گیری را انباشته می‌کند و بنابراین با تعیین کردن مناسب ضریب‌های ترکیب کاپا ۱ و ۲، این انباشتگی خطا را در طول زمان محدود می‌کنیم. محاسبه کردن مشتق‌های مرتبه اول و مرتبه دوم زاویه‌های غلت و تاب با یک تفریق ساده انجام می‌شود و در نهایت در ساختمان داده‌ی واحد موقعیت‌یاب اینرسیایی ۱ ذخیره می شود تا مدل سامانگر خطی درجه دوم از آن برای کنترل موقعیت ربات استفاده

می‌شود و نه سرعت آن‌ها. در واقع توصیف کردن تعادل ربات و تهیه کردن یک تابع تبدیل یا مدل فضای حالت بر اساس سرعت موتور پیچیدگی خاصی دارد. به همین علت بیشتر سازندگان از موتورهای جریان مستقیم در ربات‌های

روی سرعت ربات تاثیر می‌گذارد، نقش ترمز داشته و از اضافه شدن بی‌رویه‌ی سرعت ربات جلوگیری می‌کند. ضریب‌های کا پایین‌نویس ۳ و کا پایین‌نویس ۴ سعی دارند انحراف ربات و سپس نرخ تغییرات این انحراف را به صفر برسانند. هر یک از اجزاء رابطه‌ی بالا به نحوی با تغییر شتاب خطی سیستم محرکه سعی دارند که حالت متعادل را در ربات برقرار کنند. با توجه به این رابطه، حالت متعادل به معنای قرار گرفتن ربات در مکان مشخص ایکس پایین‌نویس دی و سرعت صفر در این مکان و ایجاد تعادل عمودی در آن است. بدین ترتیب کنترلر ساده تشریح شده که در حقیقت عملکردی مشابه با یک کنترلر حالت دارد، هم زاویه‌ی انحراف ربات و هم موقعیت آن را تحت

دوباره ربات به حالت متعادل و صاف برگردد (مقدار مثبت برای ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۳). همین مساله در مورد چرخش بدنه ربات به سمت جلو صادق است. به عنوان مثال، ممکن است بدنه‌ی ربات مقدار اندکی به سمت عقب متمایل شده باشد. اما در همین وضعیت، با سرعت زیاد در حال دوران به سمت جلو باشد. این یعنی اگرچه اکنون ربات به سمت عقب متمایل است، اما به زودی تغییر جهت داده و به سمت جلو کج می‌شود. این وضعیت در مواقعی که یک نیروی خارجی به صورت ناگهانی ربات را به سمت جلو هل می‌دهد، اتفاق می‌افتد. بنابراین ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۴ نیز باید مقداری مثبت باشد تا هرگاه ربات در حال دوران به سمت جلو بود، چرخ‌های آن با حرکت شتاب‌دار به جلو حرکت کرده و پیشاپیش از منحرف شدن ربات به سمت جلو پیشگیری کنند.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\nدر مورد پارامترهای کا پایین‌نویس ۱ و کا پایین‌نویس ۲ وضعیت اندکی متفاوت است. این بخش از کنترلر سعی در رساندن

نیز مثبت هستند. با دو مثال ساده این مساله را توجیه می‌کنیم. فرض کنید ربات با سرعت زیادی به سمت جلو در حال حرکت است. اکنون برای آنکه سرعت خود را کم کند، اگر ناگهان ترمز بگیرد به سمت جلو سقوط خواهد کرد. بنابراین در این وضعیت باید ابتدا با حرکت شتاب‌دار چرخ‌ها را به سمت جلو حرکت دهد تا بدنه‌ی ربات به سمت عقب متمایل شود. سپس با کمک این انحراف به عقب، می‌تواند سرعت خود را به تدریج کاهش دهد، بدون آنکه ترمز گرفتن موجب سقوط آن شود. حال فرض کنید ربات در مکان ایکس ایستاده است و می‌خواهیم به جلو حرکت کرده و به موقعیت ایکس پایین‌نویس دی برود. واضح است که در این وضعیت، عبارت تفاضل ایکس و ایکس پایین‌نویس دی مقدار منفی دارد. اکنون ربات برای حرکت به جلو مجبور است ابتدا خود را به سمت جلو خم کند و سپس به حرکت درآید. برای متمایل شدن ربات به جلو باید لحظاتی چرخ‌های آن به سمت عقب حرکت کنند (شتاب منفی). بنابر این شتاب حرکت ربات با عبارت تفاضل ایکس و ایکس پایین‌نویس دی هم‌علامت است. پس ضریب کا پایین‌نویس ۱ باید مقدار مثبت داشته باشد. پس از آنکه ربات به سمت جلو متمایل شد، ضریب‌های کا پایین‌نویس ۳ و کا پایین‌نویس ۴ به طور همزمان وارد عمل شده و ربات را با حرکت شتاب‌دار (شتاب مثبت) به جلو (به سمت مکان ایکس پایین‌نویس دی) حرکت می‌دهند. در حقیقت، عملکرد کنترلر با فعالیت همزمان چهار جزء آن که بر روی چهار پارامتر مختلف ربات (موقعیت، سرعت، زاویه و سرعت زاویه‌ای) نظارت دارند، انجام می‌شود.\n\n</p>\n</div>","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle_persian.html","page":"The Unicycle

مرکز ثقل پاندول از محور دوران فاصله‌ی خیلی کمی داشته باشد (پاندول کوتاه) کنترل تعادل دشوار خواهد بود. اما در یک بالانس‌ربات به طور لزوم چنین نیست. تفاوت این دو از نحوه‌ی تاثیر نیروی موتور در بازیابی تعادل نشات می‌گیرد. در پاندول معکوس نیروی موتور موجب به حرکت در آمدن پایه‌ی پاندول شده و به طور غیر مستقیم روی پاندول تاثیر می‌گذارد، چرا که اتصال مکانیکی میان پاندول و واگن به طور صرف یک لولای ساده است. در مقابل، در بالانس‌ربات، نیروی موتور نه تنها از طریق به حرکت در آوردن ربات بر روی تعادل آن تاثیر می‌گذارد، بلکه گشتاور داخلی (متقابل) میان موتور و چرخ نیز به بازیابی تعادل کمک می‌کند، و این به خاطر ممان اینرسی دورانی چرخ است. به عنوان مثال، فرض کنید چرخ‌های ربات به زمین چسبیده‌اند (معادل ممان اینرسی بینهایت برای چرخ‌ها). در این صورت گشتاوری که موتور به چرخ اعمال می‌کند، به طور مستقیم موجب چرخیدن بدنه ی موتور و ربات می‌شود، بدون آنکه حرکت خطی اتفاق افتاده باشد. ممکن است ربات‌های تعادلی خیلی کوچکی دیده باشید که اندازه‌ی چرخ آن در مقایسه با ابعاد ربات قابل توجه باشد. کنترل تعادل یک چنین

The exact number of runs for the RLS to converge is not constant, but we can assume that it is small when the robot approaches a state in which opposing angular momenta are balanced.

The enable pins control the speeds of rotation with a 16-bit resolution, whereas the logical input pins: 1A, 2A, 3A and 4A control the direction of rotation. A motor rotates in reverse by swapping the values of Input 1 with Input 2, switching 2 values in the memory.

LQR adds / subtracts from the two variables when it acts in the environment. To drive a direct current actuator, the driver generates an electric potential at the two ends of the actuator's coil. An electric current in the power terminals (1Y and 2Y, or, 3Y and 4Y) occurs whenever the electric potential at the two end points are sufficiently different in intensity.

The first to update is the encoder of the reaction wheel. There is an encoder wheel at the opposite the end of the reaction wheel's motor. Since the gearbox reduces the speed of rotation of the reaction wheel in exchange for multiplying the output torque, the encoder's wheel rotates faster than the reaction wheel. The difference in the speed of rotation between the output reaction wheel and the input encoder wheel allows the encoder to be more precise. Also in the motor / encoder assembley, there is an array of small magnets on the circumference of the encoder's wheel. The resolution of the encoder depends on the number of magnets in the circular array and the gearbox ratio. A Hall effect sensor produces a voltage proportional to an axial component of the magnetic field vector produced by the magnetic array. The encoder measures the absolute position of the wheel using two channels. A pair of Hall effect sensors are mounted near the surface of the encoder's wheel, such that the magnets pass by the Hall effect sensors. Timer 3 of the MCU is set up to work in encoder mode, with a register of the absolute position of the encoder's wheel. When Timer 3 is in the encoder mode, it compares the pair of channels at each rising edge of the signals to find the position. Therefore, we call the encodeWheel function with a pointer to the Encoder object of the reaction wheel along with the value of the counter register of Timer 3. The function encodeWheel updates the velocity field of the reaction wheel's encoder struct to be used in the LQR model as a system state.","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"encodeWheel(&(model->reactionEncoder), TIM3->CNT);","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"(Image: motorb)","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"The rolling wheel's encoder works the same as the reaction wheel's encoder, except for the fact that the hardware of the channels sensors is photonic rather than magnetic. The rolling wheel encoder's disk has an alternating pattern of stripes on it for a pair of infrared light emmiting diodes and a pair of photo transistors to sense its rotation. The IR LEDs send light from one side of the wheel to be received by photo transistors on the other side through the alternating pattern. The amount of light received by the photo transistors is translated to two channels of representative electrical signals, which are fed to Timer 4 of the MCU. Supplying the encodeWheel function with a pointer to the rolling wheel's encoder object and the value of the counter register of Timer 4, the function call updates the wheel velocity. Before connecting the encoder signals to the MCU timer, a voltage division is applied for making sure the amplitudes of the signals do not exceed 3.3 volts.","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"encodeWheel(&(model->rollingEncoder), TIM4->CNT);","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"(Image: motora)","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"The senseCurrent function computes the current rates of the reaction and rolling motors. The function accepts two pointers of the CurrentSensor type and updates the currentVelocity field of the respective arguments. Measuring the electric current rate is the result of two Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) channels, as peripherals of the MCU (pins PC4 and PA4 of the ADC unit). A pair of Hall effect sensors are powered using a regulated 5-Volt direct current source. To measure the current rate of the driver's output, two of the wires that connect the driver IC pins (1Y and 4Y) to the respective motor coils (MotorA2 and MotorB2), are routed in such a way that they pass by the respective current sensing Hall effect sensors. When the IC drives a voltage across the motor terminals (MA1 and MA2, or MB1 and MB2), the Hall effect sensors measure the magnetic field vector that is caused by the electric field inside the wires between the motors and the driver. The ratio-metric readings from the magnetic field vectors represent the flows of the electric current of the reaction motor's and the rolling motor's coils. The LQR model observes the current rates and regulates them to zero by generating suitable inputs.","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"senseCurrent(&(model->reactionCurrentSensor), &(model->rollingCurrentSensor));","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"(Image: currentsensing)","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"reactionwheelunicycle.html","page":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","title":"Reaction Wheel Unicycle","text":"The function updateIMU provides the main source of data for the objective of the system.
