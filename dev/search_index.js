It is the geometrical shape that relates Einstein's spacetime to quantum fields. In this model, we visualize the Hopf fibration by first calculating its points via a bundle chart and then rendering the points in 3D space via stereographic projection. The projection step is necessary because the Hopf fibration is embedded in a four-space, yet it has only three degrees of freedom as a three-dimensional shape. The idea that makes this model more special and interesting than a typical visualization is the idea of Planet Hopf, due to Dror Bar-Natan (2010). So, if the base space is a two-dimensional sphere much like the skin of the globe then we can model the Earth as a sphere and skin the horizontal sections of the bundle. Into the bargain, the Earth rotates about its axis every 24 hours. That spinning transformation of the Earth, together with the non-trivial product space of the Hopf bundle, can be encoded naturally into the visualization. It makes a lot of sense no matter how ridiculous, especially when we try to visualize differential operators in the Minkowski space-time and investigate the properties of spin-transformations. The following explains how the source code for generating animations of the Hopf fibration works (alternative views of Planet Hopf).","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Import-the-Required-Packages","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Import the Required Packages","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"Begin by importing a few software packages for doing algebraic operations, working with files and graphics processing units.

Second, interactive data visualizations and plotting in Julia are done with GLMakie. Finally, LinearAlgebra, as a module of the Julia programming language, provides array arithmetic, matrix factorizations and other linear algebra related functionality. However, through years of working with geometrical structures and shapes we have encapsulated mathematical computations and transformations into custom types and interfaces, which make up most of the functionalities of project Porta. In addition, we wrapped complicated computer graphics workflows inside custom types in order to increase the interoprability of our types with those of external packages such as GLMakie.","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"import FileIO\nimport GLMakie\nimport LinearAlgebra\nusing Porta","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html#Set-Hyperparameters","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Set Hyperparameters","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"There are essential Hyperparameters that determine the complexity of graphics rendering as well as the position and orientation of a camera, through which we render a scene. Since the output of the model is an animation video, we need to set the figure size to 1920 by 1080 to have a full high definition window, in which the scene is located. Most of the shapes and objects that we put inside of the scene are two-dimensional surfaces. Therefore, the segmentation of most shapes requires two integer values for determining how much compute power and resolution we are willing to spend on the animation. Furthermore, the shape of a circle is the most common in our scenes because of the magic of complex numbers. It is known that using 30 segments results in smooth low-polygon circles. So for a two-dimensional sphere a 30 by 30 segmented two-surface should look good. Therefore, we set the segments equal to 30 and less curvy shapes will look even better in consequence. But, an animation extends through time frame by frame and so we need to set the total number of frames. In this way, specifying the number of frames determines the length of the video. For example, 1440 frames make a one-minute video at 24 frames per second.","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"figuresize = (1920, 1080)\nsegments = 60\nbasemapsegments = 60\nframes_number = 1440","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"A model means a complicated geometrical shape contained inside a graphical scene. Every model has a name to use as the file name of the output video. Here, we choose the name planethopf as we construct an alternative view of the Planet Hopf by Dror Bar-Natan (2010). Heinz Hopf in 1931 discovered a way to join circles over the skin of the globe. The discovery defines a fiber bundle where the base space is the spherical Earth and the fibers are circles. But, the circles are all mutually parallel and linked. Moreover, the Earth goes through a full rotation about the axis that connect the poles every 24 hours. So it is not surprising that the picture of a non-trivial bundle and the spinning of the base space coordinates (longitudes) makes for a ridiculous geometric shape. But, the surprising fact is that all of it is visualizable as a 3D object. Then, we use a dictionary that maps indices to names in order to keep track of boundary data on the globe and the name of each boundary as a sovereign country.","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"modelname = \"planethopf\"\nindices = Dict()","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"The camera is a viewport trough which we see the scene.

The base map is a two-dimensional surface representing a section of the bundle, which could be horizontal or non-horizontal. A horizontal section is the one that assigns to each point of the region the same amount of fiber group action. Therefore, the tangent vectors at the points of a horizontal section, which is an open set, map to the same vector via the Hopf map.

Then, we use the exponential map for computing the Lie group values in SO(4), which are points in the bundle. A point in the Lie group is made by executing the statement exp(θ * K(1) + -ϕ * K(2)) * q, where θ and ϕ denote the latitude and longitude, respectively. K(1) and K(2) denote 4x4 matrices with real elements as a basis for so(4), the Lie algebra.

So the change of basis is the final step of the construction of the observables after defining the chart and coordinatization. Observables.jl allows us to define the points that are to be rendered in the scene, in a way that they can listen to changes dynamically. Later, when we apply transformations to the bundle, including tha change of basis, the idea is to only change the top-level observables and avoid reconstructing the scene entirely. The change of basis is a linear transformation of the tetrad in ℝ⁴ as a matrix-vector product. Here we denote the transformation as the generic function _f, which takes a Quaternion number as input and spits out a new number of the same type. The input and output bases must be orthonormal as the numbers must remain unit quaternions throughout the transforation. Constructing a base map requires a few arguments: the scene object, the central point of the section, the change of basis transformation, the chart, the number of segments of the 2-surface of observables, the tuxture of the surface and the optional transparency setting. With that, we construct four base maps in order to visualize a more complete picture of the Hopf fibration using four different sections.

By decomposing M into eigenvalues and eigenvectors we can manipulate the transformation so that it takes unit quaternions to unit quaternions without modifying its effect on the geometrical structure of the Argand plane. Despite the fact that M is a matrix of real number, it has complex eigenvalues as it involves a rotation. By constructing a four-complex-dimensional vector off of the eigenvalues we can normalize M by normalizing the vector of eigenvalues, before reconstructing a unimodular, unitary transformation (a normal matrix). The reconstructed matrix is called N and now it can be used to define a generic function f′ to replace f.","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"F = LinearAlgebra.eigen(M)\nλ = LinearAlgebra.normalize(F.values) # normalize eigenvalues for a unimodular transformation\nΛ = [λ[1] 0.0 0.0 0.0; 0.0 λ[2] 0.0 0.0; 0.0 0.0 λ[3] 0.0; 0.0 0.0 0.0 λ[4]]\nM′ = F.vectors * Λ * LinearAlgebra.inv(F.vectors)\nN = real.(M′)\nf′(x::Quaternion) = normalize(N * x)","category":"page"},{"location":"hopffibration.html","page":"Hopf Fibration","title":"Hopf Fibration","text":"We can assert that the transformation f′ takes null vectors to null vectors in Minkowski vector space 𝕍.
