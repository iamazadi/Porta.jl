# Multi-variable Functions

In General Mathematics 1, we were introduced to one-variable functions ``y = f(x)``, that had only one independent variable as input, ``x``. But in reality most of the times, we are faced with functions that have more than one independent variable. These functions are called multi-variable functions.

``y = f(x)`` a one-variable.
input ``to`` output \equiv ``x \to y``.

## Notation

- A two-variable function: ``z = f(x, y)``.
- A three-variable function is denoted by ``w = f(x, y, z)``.
- An n-variballe function: ``f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)``.

A few simple examples that show the relevance of multi-variable functions.
### Example
The area of a rectangle: ``f(x, y) = xy``.
The volume of a sphere: ``V(x, y, z) = xyz``.
The volume of a cylinder: ``V(r, h) = \pi r^2 h``.

### Example
The average of the ``n`` numbers ``x_1, x_2, ..., x_n``.
``f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i``.

## The Domain of Multi-variale Functions

The domain of the two-variable function ``f(x, y)`` is either a point in the ``x-y`` plane, or part, or the entire coordinate system ``x-y in \mathbb{R}^2 ``.

### Example

Find the domain of the follwoing functions and then plot it as a shape.

A. ``f(x, y) = 2x^3 y + x^2 y^2 - y + 5``
``D_f = \{ (x, y) | x \in \mathbb{R}, y \in \mathbb{R} \} = \mathbb{R}^2``.

B. ``f(x, y) = \frac{1}{x - y}``

``D_f = \{ (x, y) | x - y \neq 0 \} = \{ (x, y) | x \neq y \}``.

The whole plane, with the line ``y = x`` removed.

C. ``f(x, y) = \sqrt{x - y}``

``D_f = \{ (x, y) | x - y \geq 0 \} = \{ (x, y) | x \geq y \}``.

On and under the line `` y = x``.

D. ``f(x, y) = \frac{\sqrt{y - 3}}{\sqrt{5 - x}}``

``D_f = \{ (x, y) | y - 3 \geq 0, 5 - x > 0 \} = \{ (x, y) | y \geq 3, x < 5 \}``.

E. ``f(x, y) = \frac{\sqrt{y + 1}}{\sqrt[n]{2 - |x|}}``

``D_f = \{ (x, y) | y + 1 \geq 0, 2 - |x| > 0 \} = \{ (x, y) | y \geq -1, -2 < x < 2 \}``.

The shape of two-variable functions are going to be three-dimensional plots, which are also called surfaces.

``z = f(x, y)``.
The triple ``x(, y, z)``.

Since drawing three-dimensional shapes is time consuming, we just make a few examples of surfaces.

And inducing in this way, the domain of the three-variable function ``w = f(x, y, z)`` is three-dimensional, and its plot is four-dimensional.
