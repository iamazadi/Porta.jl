# Multi-variable Functions

In General Mathematics 1, we were introduced to usual functions ``y = f(x)``, that had only one independent variable as input, ``x``. But in reality most of the times, we are faced with functions that have more than one independent variable. These functions are called multi-variable functions.

``y = f(x)`` as usual.
input ``to`` output \eqiuv ``x \to y``.

## Notation

- A two-variable function: ``z = f(x, y)`
- A three-variable function is denoted by ``w = f(x, y, z)``.
- An n-variballe function: ``f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)``

A few simple examples that show the relevance of multi-variable functions.
### Example
The area of a rectangle: ``f(x, y) = xy``.
The volume of a sphere: ``V(x, y, z) = xyz``.
The volume of a cylinder: ``V(r, h) = \pi r^2 h``

### Example
The average of the ``n`` numbers ``x_1, x_2, ..., x_n``: .
