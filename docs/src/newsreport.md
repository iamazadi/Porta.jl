[Transformations](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig11transformations.jl)

An active Poincaré transformation sends the world vector ``U`` at point ``O`` to a world vector ``V`` at point ``\hat{O}``.
If the transformation also sends the the tetrad at ``O`` to a tetrad at ``\hat{O}``, then the coordinates of ``U`` are the same as those of ``V``.

[Y Negative](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig12ynegative.jl)

The abstract sphere ``\mathcal{y}^-`` of past null directions represents the observer's celectial sphere in a natural way.
The sphere ``S^-``, or its projection to sphere ``S``, gives a more concrete but less invariant realization.

[Stereographic Projection](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig13stereographicprojection.jl)

The stereographic peojection sends points from the sphere ``S^+`` into the Argand plane.
For that purpose, choose the North Pole as a point from which the map projects all other points in the sphere.
Then, the union of the plane and the point at infinity yields the Riemann sphere.

[Spherical Coordinates](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig14spherical.jl)

Light rays reaching the eyes of an observer pierce a sphere centered at the observer's position.
Specify a point in the celectial sphere with a latitude and a longitude.
The geometry of the equation ``\zeta = e^{i * \phi} cot(\theta / 2)`` relates the spherical polar angles ``\theta`` and ``\phi`` to the complex stereographic coordinate ``\zeta``.

[Stereographic Projection](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig15stereographicprojection.jl)

In Minkowski space-time, the intersection of the null cone with a plane yields a sphere.
As the plane through curve segment ``ON`` varies it provides the stereographic projection.
The point ``P`` maps to point ``P\prime``.
The parabolic intersection of the sectional plane with the cone has the same intrinsic Euclidean metric as the Argand plane.

[Four-Screw](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig1678fourscrew.jl)

A Lorentz transformations in Minkowski space-time chooses an inertial frame for an observer.
The properties of Lorentz transformations are best shown on the Riemann sphere because it has all the null directions of an observer.
A proper rotation and a boost in the ``z`` direction combine together to make a four-screw.

![9](./assets/newsreport/9.PNG)

[Null Rotation](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig19nullrotation.jl)

A null rotation is a type of Lorentz transformation where a single point is left as the only fixed point.
The rigid transformation of the Argand plane projects to a transformation on the Riemann sphere.
For the Riemann sphere, the points are displaced along circles through the south pole tangent to the y-direction there.

![10](./assets/newsreport/10.PNG)

[Null Flag](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig110nullflag.jl)

A null cone is in the tangent space of spacetime at point ``O``.
The representation of a spin-vector requires a pair of infinitesimally separated points on ``\mathcal{y}^+``.
A spin-vector is shown in terms of points ``P`` and ``P\prime`` of a null flag.

![11](./assets/newsreport/11.PNG)

[Cross-Sections](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig111crosssections.jl)

The curve segment connecting point ``O`` to point ``N`` represents the temporal direction.
The temporal direction is normal to a cross-section of the null cone.
The angle between the temporal direction of the two sections determines a metric that measures lengths and angles.
After a transformation in the linear space of the generators of the cone, the sides of triangles are multiplied by a scalar number.

![12](./assets/newsreport/12.PNG)

[SO(3)](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig112specialorthogonal3.jl)

Construct a complicated object by annihilating and creating boundaries.
Look at transformations in the tangent bundle, in order to mark the orientation of boundaries.
Follow the following 9 steps for building a tangent bundle on the 3-sphere.

1. Mark the boundary of one copy of ``SO(3)`` with sixteen vertices of a hypercube.
2. Make a tangent frame at origin point ``O`` and parallel transport it to the marked points.
3. Mark the frames with identifier ``I``.
4. Parallel transport a triad from point ``O`` to a boundary point.
5. Switch coordinate charts from chart ``N`` to chart ``S``.
6. Parallel transport the triad to the center of the counterpart copy of ``SO(3)``.
7. Parallel transport the frame to the boundary points, from the center of the other copy of ``SO(3)``.
8. Mark the frames that are parallel transported from the center of chart ``S`` at origin ``O`` with identifier ``II``.
9. Compare them with frames originated from the center of chart ``N`` at origin ``O``.

The twist in frames ``I`` compared to frames ``II`` is like the reorientation of 3D objects in the Euclidean three-dimensional space.
Even though both copies of ``SO(3)`` represent the same 3D orientation, they are distinguished from each other as points in the special linear group of complex dimension two ``SL(2,C)``.

The equivalence class of twisted frames at boundary points defines a group of rotations ``SO(3)``.
The clutching construction makes an associated vector bundle on the 3-dimensional sphere ``S^+``.
The construction creates a vector bundle through a continuous function denoted by ``f``.
The clutching function resolves the conflicts of tangent frames along the boundary.
It does so by producing an image elements in ``SO(3)`` given an element in ``SO(3) \times SO(3)``, over the intersectional region.

[Dirac's scissors problem](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig113diracsscissors.jl)

A line passing through the North Pole intersects a section at point ``P`` and makes a corresponding intersection on the other section.
For showing the metric structure of the sections we choose three points close to each other such that they make similar triangles in every section.
Dirac’s scissors problem says that a continuous rotation of the structure through 2pi toggles the sign of the half plane that is attached to it.
For toggling back the sign of the half plane, another rotation through 2pi is needed.

![14](./assets/newsreport/14.PNG)

[Spin structure: one-to-two relation between ``O^{\uparrow}_+(1,3)`` and ``SL(2,\mathbb{C})``](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig114onetotworelation.jl)

This is a one-to-two relation between a restricted Lorentz transformation and the special linear group of complex dimension two, up to a boost.
The topology of the relation is like the one-to-two relation between the special orthogonal group of real dimension three and the special unitary group of complex dimension two.
The geometric structure of similar triangles with vertices: ``P``, ``P\prime`` and ``P\prime\prime``, undergoes unrestricted spin transformations.

![15](./assets/newsreport/15.PNG)

[A null flag bundle](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig115nullflagbundle.jl)

The null-flag bundle ``F`` of ``M``, and its twofold covering space, the spin-vector bundle ``F\prime`` are shown.
The bundle projection map sends a null-flag to an event in space-time M.
Null-flags in the fiber space are 4-dimensional, which make the total space of the null-flag bundle 8-dimensional.

![16](./assets/newsreport/16.PNG)

[A unique frame ``ABCD``](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig116uniqueframe.jl)

The map to ``\mathbb{R}^4``, of future null cone and null flag, provides, in continuous fashion, a unique frame ``ABCD``.
The following 8 steps construct a unique frame that is right-handed and orthonormal with respect to the Euclidean metric of ``\mathbb{R}^4``.
1. Generate a spin-vector with two complex numbers and a time sign.
2. Use vector sum and the antipode of the spin-vector to find the timelike vector inside the future null cone.
3. Generate another spin-vector off of the first spin-vector such that the two spin-vectors make a null flag.
4. Normalize the sum of the flagpole of the original spin-vector and the flagpole of its antipode to give vector ``A`` in Minkowski vector space.
5. Calculate the axis ``B`` by projecting the flagpole to the orthogonal complement hyperplane that has ``A`` as its normal vector.
6. Calculate axis ``C`` by summing the spin-vector that is infinitesimally close to the original spin-vector with the negative of the original spin-vector.
7. Project the result onto the orthogonal hyperplane where ``A`` is its normal.
8. Find axis ``D`` by subtracting every partial component that is along ``A``, ``B`` or ``C`` from a random vector.

[A spin-frame](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig117spinframe.jl)

What is the relation between a spin-frame and a Minkowski tetrad?
A spin-frame is in a vector space over complex numbers.
The spin space has the axioms of an abstract vector space.
If a spin-vector is in ``S^-``, then under restricted spin-transformations it does not leave the sphere ``S^-`` to ``S^+``.

![18](./assets/newsreport/18.PNG)

[Spin-vectors in terms of ``S^+``](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig118spinvectorssplus.jl)

A spin-vector is a ratio between a pair of complex numbers, along with a time sign.
Spin-vectors exist in a spin-space that is equipped with three operations: scalar multiplication, inner product and addition.
Unless an unrestricted Lorentz transformation is applied, spin-vectors remain in either the sphere of past null directions ``S^-`` or ``S^+``.

![19](./assets/newsreport/19.PNG)

[Sum of angles](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig119sumofangles.jl)

In the sphere of future null directions ``S^+``, a circle connects three points: the north pole ``N``, point ``P`` and point ``Q``.
At point ``P`` a tangent vector is denoted by ``L``. Also, at point ``Q`` a tangent vector is denoted by ``M``.
Any circle on ``S^+`` through points ``P`` and ``Q`` makes the same sum-of-angles with arrows ``L`` and ``M``.

![20](./assets/newsreport/20.PNG)

[Argument of the inner product](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig120innerproductphase.jl)

The inner product of two spin-vectors ``\omega`` and ``\kappa`` is a complex number.
When they are combined in a linear fashion, the flagpoles of ``\omega`` and ``\kappa`` span a 2-plane.
Perform these 4 steps in order to calculate the argument of the scalar product.
1. Use the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method to find the orthogonal complement of the 2-plane.
2. Find the intersection of the flagplanes of ``\kappa`` and ``\omega`` with the orthogonal complement 2-plane from the previous step.
3. The flagplane of ``\kappa`` intersects along the line ``U``, whereas the flagplane of ``\omega`` intersects along the line ``V``.
4. Find the angle between ``U`` and ``V`` to measure the argument of the inner product: ``\pi + 2 arg\{\kappa, \omega\}`` (mod ``\2\pi``).

![21](./assets/newsreport/21.PNG)

[Sum of spin-vectors in terms of ``S^+``](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig121spinvectorsum.jl)

The addition of spin-vectors ``\kappa`` and ``\omega`` results in another spin-vector ``\kappa + \omega`` in the spin-space.
The tails of the flagpoles of ``\kappa``, ``\omega`` and ``\kappa + \omega`` are in a circle.
The circumcircle of the triangle made by joining the the three spin-vectors makes the same angle with each of the flagpoles.

![22](./assets/newsreport/22.PNG)

[Sum of spin-vectors in terms of the Argand plane](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig122spinvectorssumargandplane.jl)

This shows the sum of spin-vectors in a special Lorentz frame that brings out the symmetry at a spacetime event.
In this inertial frame, we have three mappings in a circular fashion: ``\kappa \mapsto -\omega``, ``\omega \mapsto \kappa + \omega``, and ``\kappa + \omega \mapsto \kappa``.
This way, the flagpole pair and their sum are collinear in the Argand plane.

![23](./assets/newsreport/23.PNG)

[A special frame that brings out the symmetry of spin-vector sum](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/spacetime/fig123specialframe.jl)

This special frame brings out the symmetry of spin-vector sum.
In this inertial frame, we have four mappings in a circular fashion:
1. ``\kappa \mapsto \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\kappa - \omega)``
2. ``\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\kappa - \omega) \mapsto -\omega``
3. ``\omega \mapsto \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\kappa + \omega)``
4. ``\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\kappa + \omega) \mapsto \kappa``
The two spin-vectors, along with their sum and subtraction, all are in a straight line.

For example, the Standard Model is formulated on 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, over which all fiber bundles can be trivialized and spinors have a simple explicit description.
For the Symmetries relevant in field theories, the groups act on fields and leave the Lagrangian or the action (the spacetime integral over the Lagrangian) invariant.
In theoretical physics, Lie groups like the Lorentz and Poincaré groups, which are related to spacetime symmetries, and gauge groups, defining *internal* symmetries, are important cornerstones.
Lie algebras are also important in gauge theories: *connections on principal bundles*, also known as *gauge boson fields*, are (locally) 1-forms on spacetime with values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group.
The Lie algebra ``SL(2,\mathbb{C})`` plays a special role in physics, because as a real Lie algebra it is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the *Lorentz group* of 4-dimensional spacetime.
At least locally, fields in physics can be described by maps on spacetime with values in vector spaces.

The adjoint representation is also important in physics, because *gauge bosons* correspond to fields on spacetime that transform under the adjoint representation of the gauge group.
As we will discuss in Sect. 6.8.2 in more detail, the group ``SL(2,\mathbb{C})`` is the (*orthochronous*) *Lorentz spin group*, i.e. the universal covering of the identity component of the Lorentz group of 4-dimensional spacetime.
The fundamental geometric opbject in a gauge theory is a principal bundle over spacetime with *structure group* given by the gauge group.
The fibers of a principal bundle are sometimes thought of as an internal space at every spacetime point, not belonging to spacetime itself.
Fiber bundles are indispensible in gauge theory and physics in the situation where spacetime, the *base manifold*, has a non-trivial topology.

It also happens if we compactify (Euclidean) spacetime ``\mathbb{R}^4`` to the 4-sphere ``S^4``.
In these situations, fields on spacetime often cannot be described simply by a map to a fixed vector space, but rather as *sections* of a non-trivial vector bundle.
We will see that this is similar to the difference in special relativity between Minkowski spacetime and the choice of an inertial system.
This can be compared, in special relativity, to the choice of an inertial system for Minkowski spacetime ``M``, which defines an identification on ``M \cong \mathbb{R}^4``.
Of course, different choices of gauges are possible, leading to different trivializations of the principal bundle, just as different choices of inertial systems lead to different identifications of spacetime with ``\mathbb{R}^4``.

Note that, if we consider principal bundles over Minkowski spacetime ``\mathbb{R}^4``, it does not matter for this discussion that principal bundles over Euclidean spaces are always trivial by Corollary 4.2.9.
This is very similar to special relativity, where spacetime is trivial, i.e. isomorphic to ``\mathbb{R}^4`` with a Minkowski metric, but what matters is the independence of the actual trivialization, i.e. the choice of inertial system.
Table 4.2 Comparison between notions for special relativity and gauge theory

|                    | Manifold                     | Trivialization                               | Transformations and invariance |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------: | :------------------------------------------: | -----------------------------: |
| Special relativity | Spacetime ``M``              | ``M \cong \mathbb{R}^4`` via inertial system | Lorentz                        |
| Gauge theory       | Principal bundle ``P \to M`` | ``P \cong M \times G`` via choice of gauge   | Gauge                          |

It follows that, given a local gauge of the gauge bundle ``P``, the section in ``E`` corresponds to a unique local map from spacetime into the vector space ``V``.
In particular, we can describe matter fields on a spacetime diffeomorphic to ``\mathbb{R}^4`` by unique maps from ``\mathbb{R}^4`` into a vector space, *once a global gauge for the principal bundle has been chosen*.
At least locally (after a choice of local gauge) we can interpret connection 1-forms as fields on spacetime (the base manifold) with values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group.
Notice that connections are **not unique** (if ``dim M, dim G \ge 1``), not even in the case of trivial principal bundles (all connections that appear in the Standard Model over Minkowski spacetime, for example, are defined on trivial principal bundles).
The diffeomorphism group ``Diff(M)`` of spacetime ``M`` plays a comparable role in general relativity.

This is related to the fact that gauge theories describe local interactions (the interactions occur in single spacetime points).
The local connection 1-form is thus defined on an open subset in the base manifold ``M`` and can be considered as a "field on spacetime" in the usual sense.
Generalized Electric and Magnetic Fields on Minkowski Spacetime of Dimension 4
In quantum field theory, the gauge field ``A_{\mu}`` is a function on spacetime with values in the operators on the Hilbert state space ``V`` (if we ignore for the moment questions of whether this operator is well-defined and issues of regularization).
By Corollary 5.13.5 this difference can be identified with a 1-form on spacetime ``M`` with values in ``Ad(P)``.

In physics this fact is expressed by saying that gauge bosons, the differences ``A_{\mu}-A_{\mu}^0``, are fields on spacetime that transform in the adjoint representation of ``G`` under gauge transformations.
In the case of Minkowski spacetime, rotations correspond to Lorentz transformations.
The pseudo-Riemannian case, like the case of Minkowski spacetime, is discussed less often, even though it is very important for physics (a notable exception is the thorough discussion in Helga Baun's book [13]).
``\mathbb{R}^{s,1}`` and ``\mathbb{R}^{1,t}`` are the two versions of *Minkowski spacetime* (both versions are used in physics).
This includes the particular case of the Lorentz group of Minkowski spacetime.

However, as mentioned above, depending on the convention, 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in quantum field theory can have signature ``(+,-,-,-)``, so that time carries the plus sign.
Example 6.1.20 For applications concerning the Standard Model, the most important of these groups is the proper orthochronous Lorentz group ``SO^+(1,3) \cong SO^+(3,1)`` of 4-dimensional Minkoeski spacetime.
They are physical gamma matrices for ``Cl(1,3)``, i.e. for the Clifford algebra of Minkowski spacetime with signature ``(+,-,-,-)``, in the so-called *Weyl representation* or *chiral representation*.
Example 6.3.18 Let ``\Gamma_a`` and ``\gamma_a = i \Gamma_a`` be the physical and mathematical gamma matrices for ``Cl(1,3)`` considered in Example 6.3.17. If we set ``\Gamma_a^\prime = \gamma_a``, ``\gamma_a^\prime = i \Gamma_a^\prime = -\Gamma_a``, then these are physical and Mathematical gamma matrices for ``Cl(1,3)`` of Minkowski spacetime with signature ``(-,+,+,+)``.
Example 6.3.24 For Minkowski spacetime of dimension 4 we have Table 6.1 Complex Clifford algebras

| ``n`` | ``Cl(n)``                                      | ``Cl^0(n)``                                            | ``N``           |

Example 6.6.7 For Minkowski spacetime ``\mathbb{R}^{n-1,1}`` of dimension ``n`` we have ``n = \rho + 2``.

We see that in Minkowski spacetime of dimension 4 there exist both Majorana and Weyl spinors of real dimension 4, but not Majorana-Weyl spinors.
In quantum field theory, spinors become fields of operators on spacetime acting on a Hilbert space.
Explicit formulas for Minkowski Spacetime of Dimension 4
We collect some explicit formulas concerning Clifford algebras and spinors for the case of 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
In Minkowski spacetime of dimension 4 and signature ``(+,-,-,-)`` (usually used in quantum field theory) there exist both Weyl and Majorana spinors, but not Majorana-Weyl spinors.
Our aim in this subsection is to prove that the orthochronous spin group ``Spin^+(1,3)`` of 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime is isomorphic to the 6-dimensional Lie group ``SL(2,\mathbb{C})``.

# The Story

## Who

![24](./assets/newsreport/24.PNG)

With the discovery of a new particle, announced on 4 July 2012 at CERN, whose properties are "consistent with the long-sought Higgs boson" [31], the final elementary particle predicted by the classical Standard Model of particle physics has been found.
Interactions between fields corresponding to elementary particles (quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, Higgs bosons), determined by the Lagrangian.
The Higgs mechanism of mass generation for gauge bosons as well as the mass generation for fermions via Yukawa couplings.
The fact that there are 8 *gluons*, 3 *weak gauge bosons*, and 1 *photon* is related to the dimensions of the Lie groups ``SU(3)`` and ``SU(2) \times U(1)``.
Lie algebras are also important in gauge theories: *connections on principal bundles*, also known as *gauge boson fields*, are (locally) 1-forms on spacetime with values in the Lie algebra of the gauge group.

The adjoint representation is also important in physics, because *gauge bosons* correspond to fields on spacetime that transform under the adjoint representation of the gauge group.
We also discuss special scalar products on Lie algebras which will be used in Sect. 7.3.1 to construct Lagrangians for gauge boson fields.
The gauge bosons corresponding to these gauge groups are described by the *adjoint representation* that we discuss in Sect. 2.1.5.
The representation ``Ad_H`` describes the representation of the gauge boson fields in the Standard Model.
The fact that these scalar products are positive definite is important from a phenomenological point of view, because only then do the kinetic terms in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian have the right sign (the gauge bosons have positive kinetic energy [148]).

*Connections* on principal bundles, that we discuss in Chap. 5, correspond to *gauge fields* whose particle excitations in the associated quantum field theory are the *gauge bosons* that transmit interactions.
These fields are often called *gauge fields* and correspond in the associated quatum field theory to *gauge bosons*.
This implies a direct interaction between gauge bosons (the gluons in QCD) that does not occur in abelian gauge theories like quantum electrodynamics (QED).
The difficulties that are still present nowadays in trying to understand the quantum version of non-abelian gauge theories, like quantum chromodynamics, can ultimately be traced back to this interaction between gauge bosons.
The real-valued fields ``A_\mu^a \in C^\infty(U,\mathbb{R})`` and the corresponding real-valued 1-forms ``A_s \in \Omega^1(U)`` are called *(local) gauge boson fields*.

In physics, the quadratic term ``[A_\mu, A_\nu]`` in the expression for ``F_{\mu\nu}`` (leading to cubic and quartic terms in the *Yang-Mills Lagrangian*, see Definition 7.3.1 and the corresponding local formula in Eq. (7.1)) is interpreted as a direct interaction between gauge bosons described by the gauge field ``A_\mu``.
This explains why gluons, the gauge bosons of QCD, interact directly with each other, while photons, the gauge bosons of QED, do not.
This non-linearity, called *minimal coupling*, leads to non-quadratic terms in the Lagrangian (see Definition 7.5.5 and Definition 7.6.2 as well as the local formulas in Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4)), which are interpreted as an interaction between gauge bosons described by ``A_\mu`` and the particles described by the field ``\phi``.
We then get a better understanding of why gauge bosons in physics are said to transform under the adjoint representation.

Strictly speaking, gauge bosons, the excitations of the gauge field, should then be described classically by the difference ``A - A^0``, where ``A`` is some other connection 1-form and not by the field ``A`` itself.
In physics this fact is expressed by saying that gauge bosons, the differences ``A_\mu - A_\mu^0``, are fields on spacetime that transform in the adjoint represntation of ``G`` under gauge transformations.
Gauge fields correspond to gauge bosons (spin 1 particles) and are described by 1-forms or, dually, vector fields.
Even though spinors are elementary objects, some of their properties (like the periodicity modulo 8, real and quaternionic structures, or bilinear and Hamiltonian scalar products) are not at all obvious, already on the level of linear algebra, and do not have a direct analogue in the bosonic world of vectors and tensors.
The existence of **gauge symmetries** is particularly important: it can be shown that a quantum field theory involving massless spin 1 bosons can be consistent (i.e. unitary, see Sect. 7.1.3) only if it is gauge invariant [125,143].

**Edward Witten** *(1987)*:

If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations:

1. Spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold ``M``, endowed with a metric tensor and governed by geometrical laws.

2. Over ``M`` is a Principal G-bundle ``X`` with a nonabelian gauge group ``G``.

3. Fermions are sections of ``(\hat{S}_+ \otimes V_R) \oplus (\hat{S}_- \otimes V_{\tilde{R}})``. ``R`` and ``\tilde{R}`` are not isomorphic; their failure to be isomorphic explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in a representation difference ``\Delta`` in some underlying theory.

All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.

## What

![26](./assets/newsreport/26.PNG)

The Higgs mechanism of mass generation for gauge bosons as well as the mass generation for fermions via Yukawa couplings.
Spin groups such as the universal covering of the Lorentz group and its higher dimesnional analogues, are also important in physics, because they are involved in the mathematical description of fermions.
Counting in this way, the Standard Model thus contains at the most elementary level 90 fermions (particles and antiparticles).
The complex vector space ``V`` of fermions, which carries a representation of ``G``, has dimension 45 (plus the same number of corresponding antiparticles) and is the direct sum of the two G-invariant subspaces (sectors): a lepton sector of dimension 9 (where we do not include the hypothetical right-handed neutrinos) and a quark sector of dimension 36.
Matter fields in the Standard Model, like quarks and leptons, or sacalar fields, like the Higgs field, correspond to sections of vector bundles *associated* to the principal bundle (and twisted by *spinor bundles* in the case of fermions).

For example, in the Standard Model, one generation of fermions is described by associated complex vector bundles of rank 8 for left-handed fermions and rank 7 for right-handed fermions, associated to representations of the gauge group ``SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)``.
Matter fields in physics are described by smooth sections of vector bundles ``E`` associated to principal bundles ``P`` via the representations of the gauge group ``G`` on a vector space ``V`` (in the case of fermions the associated bundle ``E`` is twisted in addition with a *spinor bundle* ``S``, i.e. the bundle is ``S \otimes E``).
Additional matter fields, like fermions or scalars, can be introduced using associated vector bundles.
These particles are fermions (spin ``\frac{1}{2}`` particles) and are described by spinor fields (spinors).
Dirac forms are used in the Standard Model to define a **Dirac mass term** in the Lagrangian for all fermions (except possibly neutrinos) and, together with the Dirac operator, the **kinetic term** and the **interaction term**; see Sect. 7.6.
This is related to the fact that the weak interaction in the Standard Model is not invariant under parity inversion that exchanges left-handed with right-handed fermions.

[The particular case of a *trivial* bundle and the general case of a *twisted* bundle](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig153bundle.jl)

The particular case of a “trivial” bundle is shown on the left and the general case of a “twisted” bundle on the right. Above a local open region of the base manifold we have a Cartesian product M cross V. In a trivial bundle, the points of the fiber bundle are tuples in the form of (a, b), where a denotes coordinates in the base space M and b coordinates of the fiber space V above it. Even though in the case of a non-trivial fiber bundle there’re the same tuple of coordinates for each point, the global structure of the bundle is not as simple as a cross product. But, one usually applies two or more coordinate charts in the base manifold, such that it can cover the total space appropriately.

[How twisting in a fiber bundle occurs.](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig154twisting.jl)

A trivial fiber bundle (M cross V) versus a non-trivial one is shown. To understand how the twisting in the non-trivial case occurs, suppose that the base manifold M is the two-dimensional skin of the globe, and the fiber manifold V is a one-dimensional vector space. Then, the total space of the trivial case becomes a torus of revolution (doughnuts), whereas the twisted case becomes like the Mobius strip in topological terms. In the twisted fiber bundle, the vector space of the fiber is the product M cross V whenever we select a sufficiently small subset of the base manifold, the interior of the boundary of a small country for example.

[How to glue two copies of the Riemann sphere for constructing a vector bundle.](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig155gluingspheres.jl)

How to glue two copies of the Riemann sphere together for clutching construction. The clutching construction makes a vector bundle over the sphere. But we need two coordinate charts because the vector bundle is non-trivial. The twist occurs at the boundary of the two charts (the equator), where the boundaries of two open complex planes meet and form an equivalence class of tangent vectors with the symmetry group SO(2). The clutching function takes tangent frames from one chart to the other by rotating them in order to resolve conflicts when crossing. Clutching construction gives a continuous vector field globally.

First, bring two copies of a two-dimensional sphere (closed complex planes) side by side. Second, remove the South Pole as a point from the Riemann sphere in order to make an open complex plane. Third, transform each copy of the complex plane into an open disk using azimuthal equidistant projection. Fourth, put the two open disks on top of each other and identify the corresponding points across the boundaries such that they make a closed two-surface with the identification. Fifth, toggle the sign of latitude coordinates in one of the disks and then glue the boundaries. Finally, inflate the resulting closed two-surface for making a unit two-sphere. See that both hemispheres meet each other along the boundary where the South Pole is removed. Now, using parallel transport and orthonormal tangent frames one can construct a smooth tangent bundle on the sphere. The same idea works for constructing the tangent bundle over three-sphere by removing a point from the three-sphere and repeating the steps. In the higher dimensional case, two copies of SO(3) (3D rotations) are glued together to make the symmetry group SU(2), which are unit quaternions.

[A cross-section of a fiber bundle](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig156crosssection.jl)

A cross section of a bundle is a continuous image of the base manifold, which is the skin of the globe in this particular case. A section intersects each individual fiber in a single point. The fiber bundle on the left is the Clifford parallels with four sections, whereas the fiber bundle on the right is a scalar field over the X-Y plane. For the purpose of this animation we have shown horizontal sections only. Whenever we push forward a section by the canonical projection, we get the base map image in an identical way.

![31](./assets/newsreport/31.PNG)

[Compare a cross-section of a fiber bundle with the zero section.](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig157zerosection.jl)

A cross section of a line bundle over the complex plane is shown. One of the bundles is the product bundle, and the other one is a twisted vector bundle. Note that a section intersects each fiber once. The fiber of the North Pole is colored as a prism. But a fiber above another point is also shown for comparison. The line bundle can have a global section, where in fact the Clifford bundle can’t have a global section. When you apply a section to a local region of the base space followed by the canonical projection, you get the same region back identically.

In order to understand the reason, recall that the base manifold of the Clifford bundle is a sphere, whereas the base manifold of a line bundle is the complex plane. The complex plane extends to infinity in every direction from the origin, but in the case of the Riemann sphere all directions from the North Pole end up at the South Pole in Antarctica. By the time you try to resolve the conflict in the degree of fiber twist at the South Pole, you’re talking about the clutching function. In that situation the base space is extended with a copy of itself (to make a covering space), and thus the base space is no longer a sphere and the in consequence bundle is no longer the Clifford bundle. Therefore we say that the Clifford bundle doesn’t possess a “global” section. However, “local” sections such as the boundary of a country exist without any obstruction, in both the Clifford bundle and the line bundle over the complex plane.


![32](./assets/newsreport/32.PNG)

[The Clifford bundle](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig158cliffordbundle.jl)

The Clifford bundle. Let q be a unit quaternion number and its antipodal point -q is its negative. In the two-complex-dimensional plane spanned by the orthonormal vectors w and z we find q in the unit circle. In the complex plane C^2 the unit three-sphere coordinates assert that |w|^2 + |z|^2 = 1. The coordinates are denoted by (A, B) where both numbers A and B are complex numbers as well. The coordinates of a point in the Clifford bundle is a linear combination of w and z, for example Aw + Bz = 0, where q = (A, B). But, the point (A, B) has a canonical projection in the Riemann sphere where the ratio A : B represents a unique complex number in the Argand plane. A fiber of the Clifford bundle is above a point in the Argand plane. You can see that multiplication by a unit complex number leaves the equation Ax + Bz = 0 invariant. It means that the fibers are unit circles at a given point in the w-z complex C^2 plane.


![33](./assets/newsreport/33.PNG)

[The bundle of unit tangent vectors to ``S^2``](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1510unittangentbundle.jl)

The bundle of unit tangent vectors to the sphere is a slight modification of the Clifford bundle. In the Clifford bundle, a unit quaternion number q and its antipodal point in the three-sphere -q are labeled with markers. However, when we choose a positive time sign and treat them as individual points, the tangent vectors to the two-sphere are spinorial. Two complex numbers coordinatize a quaternion number as well as a spin-vector up to a time sign. The fibers of the tangent bundle to S^2 are circles too. But, each circle-fiber of the Clifford bundle wraps twice around each circle-fiber of the tangent bundle to S^2. Because, after wrapping around each circle-fiber of the tangent bundle we return to the original phase. Then again, wrapping around each circle-fiber of the Clifford bundle once changes the sign of the point from q to -q. Therefore the number q and its negative -q are connected in the Clifford bundle, and are treated as one number in the tangent bundle.


![34](./assets/newsreport/34.PNG)

[An example of a complex line bundle](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1511complexlinebundle.jl)

In the complex two dimensional plane w-z, the unit circle is given by the equation |w|^2 + |z|^2 = 1. The complex line bundle is the entire complex line, given by Aw + Bz = 0, where A and B are complex numbers. For a straight line that crosses the origin of w-z plane, intersections with the unit circle occurs at exactly two points with antipodal configuration (namely points q and -q). However, projective complex lines from the origin all share the origin point. Compared to the bundle of unit tangent vectors, the projective lines are not disjoint because they all intersect at the origin. Unless we consider one distinct copy of the origin, with coordinates (0, 0), for each line. Unlike the unit tangent vector bundle, the complex line bundle has a complex one-dimensional space as the fiber space V. In the fiber space, tangent vectors can also grow and shrink in terms of length, as well as phase angle. In the complex line bundle, the base space is the ratio A : B, which is proportional to the slope of the line. Since the projective line is isomorphic to the complex projective line of dimension one, we have the two-sphere as the base space M of the complex line bundle. Earlier we required that each fiber gets its own origin point zero for all fibers to become disjoint. Therefore, the distinct copies of the origin per circle-fiber that we add, make a Riemann sphere in total, in order to match the base manifold of the complex vector bundle as required.


![35](./assets/newsreport/35.PNG)

[The tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1512cotangentbundle.jl)

For the 3-dimensional sphere S³, each point of its tangent bundle TS³ represents a point of S³, which is denoted by q, together with a tangent vector to S³ there. A cross-section of TS³ represents a vector field on S³. The cotangent bundle T*S³ is similar, but with covectors instead of vectors. Contangent bundles are always symplectic manifolds. In the following we describe the construction of the cotangent bundle in detail.

The symmetry group U(1) acts freely on a 3-dimensional sphere. 3-sphere is defined as the tuple (z₀, z₁) ∈ ℂ² in the complex-two-dimensional plane, such that |z₀|² + |z₁|² = 1. The squared absolute value of z sub zero plus the squared absolute value of z sub one equals unity. The free action makes the three-sphere a U(1) bundle over S² with the canonical projection π: S³ → ℂP¹, and the equivalence class of fibers over the complex projective line is mapped by z ↦ [z].

If we let q ∈ S³ be a point in 3-sphere and then use the exponential function in order to translate it in an infinitesimal way in the vertical direction (the same as U(1) action), we get a tangent vector at q. The infinitesimal action of U(1) on 3-sphere looks like v = (q * ℍ(exp(K(3) * ϵ)) - q) ∈ TS³, before normalization into a unit tangent vector at q. Assert that (q, v) = 0 to make sure that v is tangent to 3-sphere at q, where dot(.,.) denotes the standard inner product of ℝ⁴. Since q can be any point on S³ as a general point, the infinitesimal action of U(1), which is called v, is a vector field on the 3-sphere.

There is a unique connection 1-form on the U(1) bundle, given by a ∈ Ω¹(S³, ℝ𝑖) such that the ker a = v⟂. First, it means that the connection is defined on vector fields on the 3-sphere and has values in the Lie algebra of u(1). Second, the connection ‘a’ sends to zero any vector in the perpendicular subspace with respect to vector v, because infinitesimal horizontal translations of q in the base space S² result in tangent vectors that are perpendicular to v. Suppose q ∈ S³ is given by the vector q = ℝ⁴(x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄). A nowhere vanishing tangent vector at q would be u = ℝ⁴(-x₂, x₁, -x₄, x₃) ∈ TS³. Again, as a tangent vector at point q we can assert that dot(q, u) = 0. Now that we have vector v ∈ TS³ as the infinitesimal action of U(1) at q, and having established that u ∈ TS³, the inner product of u and v multiplied by the complex number 𝑖 yields the value of the connection a(u) = dot(v(q), u) 𝑖.

When we look at circle-fibers in the U(1)-bundle, we see v tangent to the fiber at each point along the circle as a vector field. Then, u and v make an angle with each other that is measured with the dot product of the connection. A bundle of such covectors on 3-sphere is called the cotangent bundle T*S³. If we push forward these covectors by the bundle projection π, then the tangent bundle of the 2-sphere is augmented with a certain phase quantity that varies depending on which element of the equivalence class is to be projected to S².

[A strained line bundle over ``S^1`` with a stretch by a positive factor](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1516strainedlinebundle.jl)

The topology of a strained plane bundle S¹ × ℝ² is the same as that of a solid torus of revolution T³. However, the second factor in the cross product, with the name ℝ², is mapped to a strained version of itself. The strain in the plane-fibers of the bundle can be measured with a connection on the bundle. Let a local section of the bundle be coordinatized with latitudes and longitudes in a region containing the origin of ℝ². In the case of torus, T³, horizontal curves have constant latitudes and longitudes above all points of S¹. Whereas in the case of the strained bundle, latitudes and longitudes are scaled given the base point that is obtained by projection on the first factor S¹. In order to go from point ‘a’ in S¹ to point ‘b’ in S¹, two different paths are possible. Going horizontally along one of the paths takes less distance to travel in the total space than the other path. This difference in the distance implies that moving in a horizontal way with respect to the connection depends on the path.

[Types of connection on a manifold](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1517typesofconnection.jl)

Types of connection on a manifold ℝ² compared. The idea of parallel transport for tangent vectors is shown, in terms of the tangent bundle T(ℝ²) of ℝ². A particular tangent vector at a point of ℝ² is represented in T(ℝ²) by a particular point of the fiber above. A horizontal curve in T(ℝ²) from this point represents the parallel transport of the tangent vector along a curve in ℝ². The same idea applies to a bundle ℝ² × S¹ over plane ℝ², other than the tangent bundle T(ℝ²), where “constant transport” in ℝ² is defined from a notion of “horizontal” in plane bundle ℝ² × S¹. 

![38](./assets/newsreport/38.PNG)

[How to make the connection of a strained line bundle over ``S^1``](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1518gluingforconnection.jl)

Consider the plane bundle S¹ × ℝ² over circle S¹. The canonical projection sends each plane-fiber ℝ² to single point in circle-base S¹. As different symmetries of the fiber space, planes can stretch/shrink along a linear combination of x-y directions, and rotate about the origin in ℝ². In the total space S¹ × ℝ², a horizontal curve with respect to flat connection is shown first. Second, by removing a point from S¹, the base space turns into a trivial region of S¹. Third, repeat the process by removing a different point of circle to give another trivial region. Fourth, identify the end points of the circular arcs after splitting, such that the two end points of one region glues to the pair of endpoints of its counterpart for making the base circle whole again. Finally, when we rescale one of the bundle parts using a symmetry of the fiber space, we get a different connection on the bundle other than the flat connection. Sections of the bundle above one region in S¹ become different in terms of scale, compared to sections above the other region. This difference in scaling between regions of S¹ comes with a connection in order to maintain a state of being horizontal along a curve.

All sections of both regions project to base manifold with the bundle projection map. But, the new connection defines a section, such that horizontal curves in the original bundle S¹ × ℝ² remain horizontal after splitting, rescaling and gluing of bundle parts. For example, in the original bundle of S¹ × ℝ², to parallel transport from point ‘a’ in S¹ to point ‘b’ in S¹ there are two curves (a clockwise/anti-clockwise rotation in S¹). In the case of flat connection, whichever curve we take the results will be the same (to end up at the same coordinates in the plane). Then again, in the modified bundle with its curved connection we arrive at different coordinates at point ‘b’, starting from point ‘a’, depending on the curve that we take. So the curved connection makes a distance function dependent on a path.


![39](./assets/newsreport/39.PNG)

[A local path dependence with curvature](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1519localpathdependence.jl)

The bundle curvature is shown, as a horizontal loop fails to close above the unit circle. In order to show a local path dependence (with bundle curvature), we need at least two dimensions in the base space of the fiber bundle. Let the base manifold be complex plane ℂ with a representation in ℝ² as well. The unit circle S¹ ∈ ℂ is parameterized with the exponent of α times the imaginary number 𝑖, where α ranges from zero to 2π. The fibers V¹ are one-dimensional and are modelled on the real line ℝ. Using 'z' as a complex number to set coordinates in the base space ℂ = M, we use the explicit connection ∇ = ∂/∂z - A, where A is a complex smooth function of z. If A is complex differentiable in a neighborhood of z, then the bundle curvature vanishes. But, if A = 𝑖 × k × z then for the part of the bundle above the unit circle S¹ we get a strained bundle with a given value of k (k = 1.0).

For this construction, first let p = exp(𝑖 × α) be a point in circle-base S¹. Second, the real and imaginary parts of p ∈ S¹ are denoted by x and y respectively. Third, we have the base point with coordinates p = ℝ³(x, y, 0.0) in the ambient space for illustration. The bundle projection maps each point to the first component of M × V¹, and that is the reason for the base point to have constant zero as the third coordinate function. However, points in the total space ℝ² × ℝ are assigned a certain "height" equal to (α / 2π) × vec(f(x, y, k))[3]. Fourth, define the function f(x, y, k) = ℝ³(x, y, k * scalarfield(real(z - A), imag(z - A))). The “scalar field” over the plane ℝ² is just the third coordinate function of the unit sphere in ℝ³, with latitude and longitude given by θ = (x + π / 2) / 2 and ϕ = y, respectively. Finally, lift a point above z = θ + ϕ × 𝑖 in base space S¹ with section f(x, y, k) + ℝ³(0.0, 0.0, height). The strain in the fiber bundle is a function of the parameter k, which is equal to 1.0 in this case. As α ranges over the closed interval with end points zero and 2π, the height of the point above z changes depending on whether the transport along S¹ is clockwise or anti-clockwise. After the curve in the base space S¹ is circumnavigated once, a winding number is added to the height value for correct coordinates in subsequent turns.

Whenever the fiber space is a complex one-dimensional vector space ℂ, a ‘real stretch’ in fibers corresponds to multiplication by a real number ℝ. See figure 15-20 in Penrose 2004.

[A complex 1-dimensional vector space as the fiber space, where the *stretch* corresponds to multiplication by a complex number.](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/gaugeconnections/fig1521stretchbycomplexnumbers.jl)

A ‘complex stretch’ in the fiber space is shown. For example, the linear right action by scalar multiplication Φ on a principal U(1)-bundle Φ: S¹ × S³ → S³ given by (ℯⁱᶿ,z) ↦ ℯⁱᶿz imposes such a complex stretch. The stretch is seen as a twist of the unit circle in the complex plane ℂ. See figure 15-21 in Penrose 2004.

Hence, by the uniqueness of integral curves (which is a theorem about the uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations) we have ``\phi_X(s) \cdot \phi_X(t) = \phi_X(s + t) \ \forall t \in I \cap (t_{min} - s, t_{max} - s)``.
This implies the claim by uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations.
The unique solution of this differential equation for ``\gamma(t)`` is ``\gamma(t) = e^{tr(X)t}``.
Then ``e^D = \begin{bmatrix} e^{d_1} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{d_2} & 0 \\  & \ddots &  \\ 0 & 0 & e^{d_n} \end{bmatrix}`` and the equation ``det(e^D) = e^{d_1} ... e^{d_n} = e^{d_1 + ... + d_n} = e^{tr(D)}`` is trivially satisfied.
Then we can calculate: ``(R^*_gs)_p(X,Y) = \ <L_{(pg)^{-1}*}R_{g*}(X), L_{(pg)^{-1}*}R_{g*}(Y)> \ = \ <Ad_{g^{-1}} \circ L_{p^{-1}*}(X), Ad_{g^{-1}} \circ L_{p^{-1}*}(Y)>`` and ``s_p(X,Y) \ = \ <L_{p^{-1}*}(X), L_{p^{-1}*}(Y)>``, where in both equations we used that ``s`` is left invariant.

Lemma 3.3.3 For ``A \in Mat(m \times m, \mathbb{H})`` and ``v \in \mathbb{H}^m`` the following equation holds: ``det\begin{bmatrix}1 & v \\ 0 & A\end{bmatrix} = det(A)``.
Lemma 4.1.13 (Cocycle Conditions) The transition functions ``\{\phi_{ij}\}_{i,j \in I}`` satisfy the following equations:

- ``\phi_{ii}(x) = Id_F \ for \ x \in U_i``,
- ``\phi_{ij}(x) \circ \phi_{ji}(x) = Id_F \ for \ x \in U_i \cap U_j``,
- ``\phi_{ik}(x) \circ \phi_{kj}(x) \circ \phi_{ji}(x) = Id_F \ for \ x \in U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k``.

The third equation is called the **cocycle condition**.

5.5.2 The structure equation
Theorem 5.5.4 (Structure Equation) The curvature form ``F`` of a connection form ``A`` satisfies ``F = dA + \frac{1}{2}[A,A]``.

Proof We check the formula by inserting ``X,Y \in T_pP`` on both sides of the equation, where we distinguish the following three cases:
1. Both ``X`` and ``Y`` are vertical: Then ``X`` and ``Y`` are fundamental vectors, ``X = \tilde{V}_p, \ Y = \tilde{W}_p`` for certain elements ``V,W \in g``. We get ``F(X,Y) = dA(\pi_H(X), \pi_H(Y)) = 0``. On the other hand we have ``\frac{1}{2}[A,A](X,Y) = [A(X),A(Y)] = [V,W]``. The differential ``dA`` of a 1-form ``A`` is given according to Proposition A.2.22 by ``dA(X,Y) = L_X(A(Y))-L_Y(A(X))-A([X,Y])``, where we extend the vectors ``X`` and ``Y`` to vector fields in a neighbourhood of ``p``. If we choose the extension by fundamental vector fields ``\tilde{V}`` and ``\tilde{W}``, then ``dA(X,Y) = L_X(W) - L_Y(V) - [V,W] = -[V,W]`` since ``V`` and ``W`` are constant maps from ``P`` to ``g`` and we used that ``[\tilde{V},\tilde{W}] = \widetilde{[V,W]}`` according to Proposition 3.4.4. This implies the claim.
2. Both ``X`` and ``Y`` are horizontal: Then ``F(X,Y) = dA(X,Y)`` and ``\frac{1}{2}[A,A](X,Y) = [A(X), A(Y)] = [0,0]=0``. This implies the claim.
3. ``X`` is vertical and ``Y`` is horizontal: Then ``X = \tilde{V}_p`` for some ``V \in g``. We have ``F(X,Y) = dA(\pi_H(X),\pi_H(Y)) = dA(0, Y) = 0`` and ``\frac{1}{2}[A,A](X,Y) = [A(X),A(Y)] - [V,0] = 0``. Furthermore, ``dA(X,Y) = L_{\tilde{V}}(A(Y)) - L_Y(V) - A([\tilde{V},Y]) = -A([\tilde{V},Y]) = 0`` since ``[\tilde{V},Y]`` is horizontal by Lemma 5.5.5. This implies the claim.

The structure equation is very useful when we want to calculate the curvature of a given connection.

By the structure equation we have ``F = dA + \frac{1}{2} [A, A]`` so that ``dF = \frac{1}{2} d[A, A]``.

Proposition 5.6.2 (Local Structure Equation) The local field strength can be calculated as ``F_s = dA_s + \frac{1}{2}[A_s,A_s]`` and ``F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu, A_\nu]``.

It remains to check that ``F_M`` is closed. In a local gauge ``s`` we have according to the local structure equation ``F_s = dA_s + \frac{1}{2}[A_s,A_s]``.

Proposition 5.6.8 For the connection on the Hopf bundle the following equation holds: ``\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{S^2} F_{S^2} = 1``.

We write ``A_\mu = A_s(\partial_\mu), F_{\mu\nu} = F_s(\partial_\mu, \partial_\nu)`` and we have the local structure equation ``F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu, A_\nu]``.

We will determine ``g(t)`` as the solution of a differential equation.

Proof Properties 1-3 follow from the theory of ordinary differential equations. (Parallel transport)

These covariant derivatives appear in physics, in particular, in the Lagrangians and field equations defining gauge theories.

Recall that for the proof of Theorem 5.8.2 concerning the existence of a horizontal lift ``\gamma^*`` of a curve ``\gamma:[0,1] \to M`` where ``\gamma^*(0) = p \in P_{\gamma(0)}``, we had to solve the differential equation ``\dot{g}(t) = -R_{g(t)*} A(\dot{\delta}(t))``, with ``g(0) = e``, where ``\delta`` is some lift of ``\gamma`` and ``g:[0,1] \to G`` is a map with ``\gamma^*(t) = \delta(t) \cdot g(t)``.

Then the differential equation can be written as ``\frac{dg(t)}{dt} = -A_s(\dot{\gamma}(t)) \cdot g(t)``.

Path-ordered exponentials are useful, because they define solutions to the ordinary differential equation we are interested in.

Then uniqueness of the solution to ordinary differential equations show that ``g \equiv h``, hence ``g`` takes values in ``G``.

The solution to this differential equation is

``g(t) = P exp(- \int_0^t \sum_{\mu=1}^n A_{s\mu}(\gamma(s))\frac{dx^\mu}{ds}ds) = P exp(- \int_{\gamma(0)}^{\gamma(t)} \sum_{\mu=1}^n A_{s\mu} (x^\mu) dx^\mu) = P exp(- \int_{\gamma_t} A_s)``,
where ``\gamma_t`` denotes the restriction of the curve ``\gamma`` to ``[0,t]``.

What is the interpretation of the structure equation?

Taking the determinant of both sides of this equation shows that:

Lemma 6.1.7 Matrices ``A \in O(s,t)`` satisfy ``detA = \pm 1``.

``A^T \begin{bmatrix} I_s & 0 \\ 0 & -I_t \end{bmatrix} A = \begin{bmatrix} I_s & 0 \\ 0 & -I_t \end{bmatrix}``.

Remark 6.2.5 We can think of the linear map ``\gamma`` as a **linear square root** of the symmetric bilinear form ``-Q``: in the definition of Clifford algebras, it suffices to demand that ``\gamma(v)^2 = -Q(v,v) \cdot 1 \ \forall \ v, w \in V``, because, considering this equation for vectors ``v, w, v + w``, the equation ``\{\gamma(v), \gamma(w\} = -2Q(v, w) \cdot 1 \ \forall \ v, w \in V`` follows.

Lemma 6.3.6 Every chirality element ``\omega`` satisfies
- ``\{\omega,e_a\} = 0``
- ``[\omega,e_a \cdot e_b] = 0 \ \forall \ 1 \le a, b \le n``.

Proof The first equation follows from
``e_a \cdot \omega = \lambda e_a \cdot e_1 ... e_n = (-1)^{a - 1} \lambda e_1 ... e_a \cdot e_a ... e_n``

``\omega \cdot e_a = \lambda e_1 ... e_n \cdot e_a = (-1)^{n - a} \lambda e_1 ... e_a \cdot e_a ... e_n = -e_a \cdot \omega``,

since ``n`` is even. The second equation is a consequence of the first.

Let ``\Gamma_1, ..., \Gamma_n`` be physical gamma matrices. We set

``\Gamma_a = \eta^{ac} \Gamma_c``,

``\Gamma^{bc} = \frac{1}{2} [\Gamma^b, \Gamma^c] = \frac{1}{2} (\Gamma^b \Gamma^c - \Gamma^c \Gamma^b)``,

``\Gamma^{n + 1} = -i^{k + t} \Gamma^1 ... \Gamma^n``

and similarly for the mathematical ``\gamma``-matrices (in the first equation there is an implicit sum over ``c``; this is an instance of the Einstein summation convention). These matrices satisfy by Lemma 6.3.6

``\{\Gamma^{n + 1}, \Gamma^a\} = 0``,

``[\Gamma^{n + 1}, \Gamma^{bc}] = 0``,

``\gamma^{bc} = -\Gamma^{bc}``.

In the following examples we use the Pauli matrices

``\sigma_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}``, ``\sigma_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}``, ``\sigma_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}``.

It is easy to check that they satisfy the identities

``\sigma^2 = I_2 \ \ j = 1, 2, 3``,

``\sigma_j \sigma_{j + 1} = -\sigma_{j + 1} \sigma_{j} = i \sigma_{j + 2} \ \ j = 1, 2, 3``,

where in the second equation ``{j + 1}`` and ``j + 2`` are taken ``mod 3``.

``(\psi, \phi) = \psi^T C \phi``

Furthermore property 1. and 2. in Definition 6.7.1 are equivalent to

1. ``\gamma_a^T = \mu C \gamma_a C^{-1} \ \ for \ all \ a = 1, ..., s + t``.
2. ``C^T = \nu C``.

The first equation also holds with the physical Clifford matrices ``\Gamma_a`` instead of the mathematical matrices ``\gamma_a``.

There is an equivalent equation to the first one with physical Clifford matrices ``\Gamma_a : 1 \cdot \Gamma^\dagger_a = -\delta A \Gamma_a A^{-1} \ \ for \ all \ a = 1, ..., s + t``.

Furthermore, property 1. and 2. in Definition 6.7.8 are equivalent to:

1. ``\gamma_a^{\dagger} = \delta A \gamma_a A^{-1} \ \ for \ all \ a = 1, ..., s + t``.
2. ``A^{\dagger} = A``.

Given a spin structure on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and the spinor bundle ``S``, we would like to have a covariant derivative on ``S`` so that we can define field equations involving derivatives of spinors.

What is F_A geometrically?
The loop integral of a connection at a point q along the edges of a parallelogram with infinitesimal edges is equal to the exterior derivative of the connection A, which in turn equals F. The exterior derivative of the connection 1-form A is a 2-form F, which has two indices downstairs in order to denote two inputs. The point q is a vertex of the infinitesimal parallelogram where two of the edges intersect. These edges are inputs to the 2-form F.
What are R_munu and R geometrically?
Whenever matter is not present, like inside vacuum, spacetime curves under tidal force fields that deform a sphere of test particles into an egg-shaped surface. However, when matter is present, then a volume-reducing force field deforms spacetime too. From the inverse-square law of Newtonian physics we understand gravity as the volume-preservation of the Ricci component of the Riemann curvature tensor. The Riemann curvature tensor is a three-piece object, two of whose components are denoted by R_munu and R. Einstein’s spacetime discards the Weyl component of the curvature tensor and calculates the scalar curvature component R by taking the trace of the Ricci curvature component. 
How do they relate?
The role of the Weyl curvature is not explained by Einstein’s field equation, even though cosmological observations suggest a role for it on a large scale. Einstein’s field equation combines the tidal effects of preserving the volume of spatial planes with respect to time, R_munu, and changes in matter density which turn out to be the curvature scalar R.
What does this have to do with Penrose steps?
When the Riemann curvature tensor in the presence of matter shows R_munu not equal to zero, the vector fields that flow along spatial and temporal directions deviate from their orthogonal geodesics. The Ricci curvature takes two vectors as input and outputs a scalar number. For an infinitesimal parallelogram at a spacetime event, the Ricci scalar is just the integral of a 1-form along the edges of the infinitesimal parallelogram. The exterior derivative of the 1-from becomes nonzero and so parallel transport stretches the path of a tangent vector with multiplication by either a scalar or a complex number. In a principal U(1)-bundle, a circular path in the base space forms a stack of circles in the total space as a result of the stretch with multiplication (in the presence of matter.) Therefore, the trajectory of a tangent vector along a circular path on the base space forms a spiral in the total space, which resembles the shape of Penrose steps or the Escher staircase. 
What are “horizontal subspaces” and what do they have to do with vector potentials and gauge fields?
A connection (denoted by A) on a principal G-bundle P assigns a horizontal subspace of the tangent space to each point q in P, in a smooth way. First, the tangent space of a principal bundle P at point q is equal to the direct sum of the vertical subspace and the horizontal subspace at q, for all q in P. Second, the push forward of the horizontal subspace of the Principal G-bundle P at point q by an action g of the structure group G is equal to the horizontal subspace of the principal G-bundle P at the transformation of the point q by the action g, for all g in G and q in P.
The Ricci curvature is 2-form with respect to a connection 1-form on spacetime. The 2-form that appears in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian is exact if and only if it is equal to the loop integral of a 1-form along the boundary of a very small oriented area (F_munu = dϕ). In other words, the loop integral of the 1-form ϕ, along the boundary of a region (a parallelogram) equals the integral of the exterior derivative of the 1-form over the region. But if this 1-form exists (an exact symmetry,) then the integral introduces a gauge potential, where one has the freedom to change the constant as a reference level, also known as a gauge transformation.

[Configuration space](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig201configurationspace.jl)

The configuration space of Unicycle is a manifold of dimension N, each of whose points represents a possible configuration of chassis, reaction wheel and rolling wheel. As the system evolves in time, a sequence of telemetry frames make a curve in the configuration space. The behavior of Unicycle follows a curve in the configuration space, and is constrained with a function that is defined on the tangent bundle of configuration space. We are free to change the laws of motion of the robot by programming a microcontroller. However, a program must respect the constraints of the Lagrangian function in order to achieve the goal of its mission.

[The Lagrangian on the tangent bundle of configuration space ``T(\mathcal{C})`` vs. the Hamiltonian ``\mathcal{H}`` on the cotangent bundle ``T^*(\mathcal{C})`` (phase space)](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig202phasespace.jl)

Showing a unique connection ‘a’ on the Clifford bundle requires the specification of a point ‘p’ in the bundle, as well as the infinitesimal action ‘v’ of the structure group and a direction ‘X’ in the horizontal subspace. Then, the value of the connection 1-form ‘a’ equals the scalar product of ‘v’ and ‘X’, which is in the Lie algebra of the fiber symmetry group. In the neighborhood of point ‘p’, the connection ‘a’ as a gauge field is not constant in every direction. So we take the exterior derivative of ‘a’ at ‘p’ to get a better look at the structure of the bundle. The tangent space at ‘p’ is a 3-dimensional manifold that is distributed into horizontal and vertical subspaces, because ‘a’ is an Ehresmann connection. This is different from the Levi-Civita connection that describes the structure of spacetime. In other words, the entire Clifford bundle is located at single spacetime event. The Yang-Mills Lagrangian is a smooth function on the tangent bundle of configuration space, because the curvature 2-form (as a result of the exterior derivative of connection 1-form ‘a’) is defined everywhere in the configuration space. Alternatively the Hamiltonian is defined as a smooth function on the cotangent bundle of configuration space (phase space).

[Hamilton's principle](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig203hamiltonprinciple.jl)

Hamilton's principle. The Yang-Mills Lagrangian is a smooth function that is defined on the tangent bundle of configuration space. One derives the equations of motion for (mostly) kinetic particles such as photons (and neutrinos) using Hamilton's principle. A particle moves through the configuration space such that the integral of the Lagrangian along a path between two fixed points is stationary, under variations of the curve. But, the Yang-Mills Lagrangian is an adjoint-invariant scalar product of the curvature 2-form on a principal G-bundle over spacetime. The adjoint bundle is an associated vector bundle of the principal G-bundle, whose values represent the difference between two connections. Furthermore, the curvature 2-form is the exterior derivative of a connection 1-form on the principal bundle. Therefore, the Lagrangian forces a particle to move in the direction of the smallest ξ arrow, which makes ξ tangent to the curve.

[Staitionary values of a smooth real-valued function ``f`` of several variables](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig204stationaryvalues.jl)

Geodesic curves describe the shortest distance between two fixed points in a smooth manifold. The specification of a path in this example requires two variables x and y. In general, the Lagrangian requires many variables to be fully specified. The tangent bundle of the configuration space of a dynamical system has geodesic curves, along which the integral of the Lagrangian is stationary. 

A scalar field of two variables is shown, which has two stationary points. The exterior derivative of the field at a stationary point is very small in every direction. The partial derivative of the scalar field with respect to x equals zero at a local minimum or maximum. Also, the partial derivative of the field with respect to y is equal to zero, at either of the stationary points where its two-dimensional surface is horizontal.

Another kind of stationary value occurs at saddle points, where a curve with positive curvature intersects a curve with negative curvature. This 2-surface has an inflection point along a straight line crossing the center of the shape. An inflection point, because at the center, curvature changes sign along one direction while it equals zero along the orthogonal direction.

[The Hamiltonian flow](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig205hamiltonianflow.jl)

The set of equally spaced parallel planes is called a stack. The positive direction agrees with the motion of a falling particle in the gravitational field of the Earth. The stack represents the gravitational work 1-form and its direction is downward. A golden particle travels in the direction of the black arrow. Over the first few seconds of falling towards the Earth’s center, the traveling distance is short. That is why the spacing is approximately constant between every parallel plane in the stack. The 1-form of the motion vector equals the sum of planes pierced by the vector. The greater the value of work 1-form, the higher the density of stack planes. It is equivalent to the work done moving the particle mass along the vector. The magnitude of the gravitational field (the gravitational constant) for a mass near the surface of the Earth is equal to the inverse of the spacing between planes. See figures 32.2,3 in Tristan Needham 2021.

The Hamiltonian flow is a vector field on phase space. Given initial position and momentum, the Newtonian time-evolution of the falling particle is shown using arrows on the cotangent bundle of configuration space. Per unit mass, the Hamiltonian equals the squared norm of the particle's momentum over two, plus the gravitational constant times the norm of the particle's position. Given a momentum initialization, the Hamiltonian values are fixed for all positions in a plane. The potential energy is the same everywhere in a plane in the stack, and is proportional to the norm of position, which is the radius of the Earth plus the height of the particle from the Earth’s surface. As the particle falls freely, it follows a geodesic trajectory in the configuration space, as if gravity is removed. Then the total energy of the dynamical system is conserved to make the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to time equal to zero. Falling to the Earth, the particle must gain as much kinetic energy (momentum) as it loses in potential energy (height). See figure 20-5 in Roger Penrose 2005.

[Small oscillations](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig206smalloscillations.jl)

A pendulum, swinging under gravity. For small oscillations, the motion of the bob approximates simple harmonic motion, the displacement of the bob (mapped out as a function of time) giving a ‘sine wave’. The equation of motion is derived from the Hamiltonian H(p, q) = norm(p)^2 / (2 * l^2) + l * (1 - cos(q)), where ‘l’ denotes the length of the pendulum, and (p, q) denotes a tuple of the pendulum's bob momentum and position from the stable equilibrium point, respectively. Here, mass and the gravitational acceleration of the Earth don’t come into the equation of simple harmonic motion for unity. Then, for small displacements of the bob, the equation of motion is derived: the second derivative of position with respect to time (acceleration) is proportional to the outward motion. Solving the equation of motion, a sine wave, a cosine wave, and a linear combination of sine and cosine waves satisfy the equation. It was the observation of Galileo in 1583 that the period of oscillation, for such small oscillations, is independent of the amplitude of the oscillation (the maximum distance away from the stable equilibrium point.) One way to achieve such a small oscillation is to initialize the position vector with a very small magnitude.

We know that the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to momentum equals the derivative of position with respect to time. Now, if we take the derivative of the partial derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to momentum, with respect to time, then we find a matrix-vector product. But, the second derivative of position with respect to time (acceleration) is one side of the equation of motion, which is proportional to position. After a power series expansion of the Hamiltonian about the equilibrium point, the proportionality of acceleration and position of the pendulum bob turn out to be equal to the eigenvalue of the matrix in the linear transformation (the matrix-vector product.) Since the transformation is a subgroup of an orthogonal group (rotation,) the matrix representation of the pendulum’s Newtonian time-evolution is unitary. We also know that the matrix representation of an orthogonal group preserves a positive-definite scalar product. Therefore, the eigenvalue of the transformation is positive and has a positive square root. Dividing the square root of the eigenvalue by two pi yields the normal frequency of the normal mode, which is the one eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue. Because the pendulum’s motion is restricted to a plane in this example, there is only one normal mode. See also figure 20-6 in Roger Penrose 2005.

[Liouville's theorem](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig207liouvillestheorem.jl)

The boundary nodes of a sovereign country are in the stack of gravitational work 1-form. The configuration space of a falling particle near the surface of the Earth specifies: an altitude above a geographic coordinate (latitude and longitude), along with a velocity vector (or momentum per unit mass.) The Hamiltonian is interpreted as the total energy of a falling particle. One needs to look at the cotangent bundle of the configuration space, in order to define a Hamiltonian for a particle's motion. In free fall motion, total energy is conserved because the particle follows a geodesic trajectory. It implies that the work 1-form transforms potential energy to kinetic energy, such that the total energy of the system is conserved but the kind of energy is transformed. Therefore, the Hamiltonian is constant all along as a scalar field, while the configuration of the particle evolves according to the Hamiltonian flow. The cotangent bundle of the configuration space is where the gravitational work 1-form is defined. The value of the work 1-form is calculated by counting how many planes the velocity arrow pierces. The planes in the particle’s path are counted as positive whenever the direction of the work 1-form pierced by the vector agrees with the vector’s direction, and negative otherwise.

The boundary nodes are inscribed inside a parallelogram, where two horizontal vectors make the edges. An area 2-form eats the edges and spits out an area of scalar type. A 2-form is a completely antisymmetric tensor of valence {0 2}^T, meaning that swapping the pair of inputs changes the sign of the area as a result. Swapping the two edges as inputs to the area 2-form, the sign of the output area changes. Liouville’s theorem states that the Hamiltonian flow preserves the area of the initial phase-space boundary (representing a range of possible initial momentum states), even though the shape of this boundary becomes distorted in the time-evolution.

[The reduced phase space of ``T^*(\mathcal{C})``](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig208phasespace.jl)

The time-evolution of a particle of unit mass falling to the Earth’s surface is derived from a function called the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is defined on the phase space, where the specification of the position and momentum of the particle requires a 6-dimensional vector [q; p]. In terms of position ‘q’ and momentum ‘p’, the Hamiltonian is defined as: the squared norm of p over two, plus the norm of q times the gravitational constant ‘g’. The exterior derivative of the gravitational work 1-form (the stack) equals approximately zero (it’s constant,) because seconds after the beginning of falling to Earth, the particle’s still near the surface. So, the Hamiltonian is defined on the cotangent bundle of a 3-dimensional configuration space, which is a 6-dimensional symplectic manifold (also known as phase space.)
Under gravity, the particle falls along a geodesic curve (radial lines) in the configuration space. The value of the Hamiltonian function is constant throughout the motion, which implies the conservation of the sum of kinetic and potential energies. In the phase space, there is a 5-dimensional region containing a 4-dimensional family of the Hamiltonian flow trajectories. The reduced phase space, whose points represent these trajectories, is itself a 4-dimensional symplectic manifold. The degrees of freedom of the 5-dimensional region can be thought of as the latitude and longitude coordinates along with a 3-vector momentum vector. However, the 4-dimensional symplectic manifold removes an axis from the momentum vector. The partial component of the momentum vector that is removed from the phase space is calculated by projecting the momentum vector on the line tangent to the trajectory. It’s remarkable that the reduced phase space can still be the configuration space of a smaller physical system and is allowed to have its own reality.

[Hamilton's principle for field Lagrangians](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig209fieldlagrangians.jl)

Points in S³ are represented by unit Quaternion numbers (vectors in ℝ⁴.) Multiplication on both the left and right sides of a Quaternion number with another Quaternion preserves the round metric on S³. There are three different flows on the surface of the 3-sphere. The first flow is in the direction of the vector field K₁, the second flow follows along vector field K₂, and finally the third flow moves in the direction of K₃ ∈ so(4). Each element of the vector fields K₁, K₂ and K₃ is a 4x4 matrix of real elements ℝ, as a basis for the special orthogonal group so(4), the Lie algebra of the group of rotations of ℝ⁴ and motions in S³. Since lengths and angles are preserved along the flows, the Quaternionic motion pushes elements around in a 3-sphere. Yet, so(4) is a 6-dimensional symmetry group because multiplication is not commutative for a pair of Quaternions. Another way to think about it is: four choose two equals six, where we count the number of basis 2-forms in four dimensions. As a consequence, there is a linear transformation that preserves a scalar product, mapping from 2 copies of S³ to the Special Orthogonal group of real dimension 4, SO(4). However, the multiplication of the identity matrix with itself results in no motion at all, so does the multiplication of minus identity with itself. Therefore, if we denote the 4 by 4 identity matrix with ‘I’, then the tuple of inputs (I, I) and (-I, -I) are in the kernel of the map: S³ × S³ \ {(I, I), (-I, -I)} → SO(4).

An Ehresmann connection distributes the tangent bundle of S³ into two orthogonal subspaces. Vectors tangent to S³ make a right angle with a radial line. A connection 1-form ϕ on the Clifford bundle eats a vector tangent to S³ as input, and together with the infinitesimal motion along K₃, uses a scalar product to spit out a scalar number as output. On the other hand, vectors ϵu and ϵv show infinitesimal motions in the direction of K₁ and K₂, respectively. Then, the exterior derivative of the 1-form is calculated as Ω = (ϕb_v - ϕd_v) - (ϕc_u - ϕa_u), where ϕa_u denotes the value of the 1-form ϕ at point ‘a’ in the direction of ϵu. So, the exterior derivative of a 1-form ϕ is a 2-form Ω. We assume that all three flows (K₁, K₂ and K₃) are closed, meaning the exterior derivative of each one of the flows equals zero. Counting the number of equally-spaced sections pierced by K₃, one finds that the flow has non-zero period (circulation). Now, for a general vector field on S³ where a linear combination of vector fields K₁, K₂ and K₃ represents a flow, the period is no longer a scalar and is calculated as a 3-vector of the contribution of each one of the three flows. This implies that the first de Rahm cohomology group of S³ is equal to ℝ³.

But, the Yang-Mills Lagrangian is one half of the scalar product of a 2-form with respect to a connection 1-form on spacetime. The 2-form that appears in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian is exact if and only if it is equal to the loop integral of a 1-form along the boundary of a very small oriented area. In other words, the loop integral of the 1-form ϕ, along the boundary of a region (the parallelogram with vertices a, b, c and d) equals the integral of the exterior derivative of the 1-form (dϕ) over the region. But if this 1-form exists (an exact symmetry,) then the integral introduces a scalar constant and one has the freedom to change the constant as a reference level (also known as a gauge transformation.)

After continuous deformations of a parallelepiped at point ‘p’, one can think of the volume form of three tangent vectors in K₁, K₂ and K₃ as a blister, enclosing a 3-region. The exterior derivative of a closed 2-form (dΩ) is equal to zero. Deformation theorem for closed 2-forms states that the period of a closed 2-form out of a closed 2-surface is invariant under a continuous deformation of the surface. Because the 2-form is closed dΩ = 0, what flows into the blister must flow out. So the flux out of the volume is invariant under deformations. Furthermore, Hamilton’s principle for field Lagrangians means that a field configuration follows a geodesic in the configuration space, whose tangent bundle is where the Lagrangian is defined. The case that we illustrate here, configures the 2-form with two vectors ϵu and ϵv in the horizontal subspace at ‘p’, where the loop integral of ϕ along the boundary of a parallelogram (with midpoints a, b, c and d) is stationary. In spacetime however, the Yang-Mills Lagrangian scales a 4-form at each point, such that the integral of the scaled differential form is stationary over a 4-region, which is enclosed between two fixed 3-regions. The boundary of the pair of 3-regions can come together in an asymptotic way, or they can be glued together. For example, in the case of gluing two copies of a sphere together, we use the clutching construction to build the tangent bundle, which in turn gives rise to spinors that define the Dirac Lagrangian.

[Hamilton's principle for field Lagrangians](https://github.com/iamazadi/Porta.jl/blob/master/models/newsreport/lagrangians/fig2010fieldlagrangians.jl)

A connection (denoted by A) on a principal G-bundle P assigns a horizontal subspace of the tangent space to each point q in P, in a smooth way. First, the tangent space of a principal bundle P at point q is equal to the direct sum of the vertical subspace and the horizontal subspace at q, for all q in P. Second, the push forward of the horizontal subspace of the Principal G-bundle P at point q by an action g of the structure group G is equal to the horizontal subspace of the principal G-bundle P at the transformation of point q by the action of g, for all g in G and q in P.
The loop integral of a connection at a point q along the edges of a parallelogram with infinitesimal edges is equal to the exterior derivative of the connection A, which in turn equals F. The exterior derivative of the connection 1-form A is a 2-form F, which has two indices downstairs in order to denote two inputs. The point q is a vertex of the infinitesimal parallelogram where two of the edges intersect. These edges are inputs to the 2-form F.
A field Lagrangian can be as simple as the scalar product of a 2-form with itself. Then, Hamilton’s principle expresses that the integral of a 4-form on spacetime with the density of some Lagrangian over a 4-dimensional region is stationary. The boundary of a well-behaved compact oriented 4 dimensional region is a (compact oriented) 3-dimensional region, consisting of those points of the 4-region that do not lie in the 4-dimensional interior. The 4-region has a boundary that is constructed with a pair of 3-regions. According to Hamilton’s principle for field Lagrangians, the loop integral of a 3-form along the 3-region boundaries is stationary. For example, by first puncturing two 3-spheres and then gluing them together along their boundaries, one can obtain a pair of 3-regions in spacetime that enclose a 4-region over which the integral of a 4-form is performed. In this example the boundary of a punctured 3-sphere is a 2-dimensional sphere.


The following three chapters discuss applications in physics: the Lagrangians and interactions in the Standard Model, spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs mechanism of mass generation, and some more advanced and modern topics like neutrino masses and CP violation.
Depending on the time, the interests and the prior knowledge of the reader, he or she can take a shortcut and immediately start at the chapters on connections, spinors or Lagrangians, and then go back if more detailed mathematical knowledge is required at some point.
An interesting and perhaps underappreciated fact is that a substantial number of phenomena in particle physics can be understood by analysing representations of Lie groups and by rewriting or rearranging Lagrangians.

Symmetries of Lagrangians
interactions between fields corresponding to elementary particles (quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, Higgs boson), determined by the Lagrangian.
For the symmetries relevant in field theories, the groups act on fields and leave the *Lagrangian* or the *action* (the spacetime integral over the Lagrangian) invariant.
In the following chapter we will study some associated concepts, like representations (which are used to define the actions of Lie groups on fields) and invariant matrices (which are important in the construction of the gauge invariant Yang-Mills Lagrangian).
We also discuss special scalar products on Lie algebras which will be used in Sect. 7.3.1 to construct Lagrangians for gauge boson fields.

The existence of positive definite Ad-invariant scalar products on the Lie algebra of compact Lie groups is very important in gauge theory, in particular, for the construction of the gauge-invariant *Yang-Mills Lagrangian*; see Sect. 7.3.1.
The fact that these scalar products are positive definite is important from a phenomenological point of view, because only then do the kinetic terms in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian have the right sign (the gauge bosons have positive kinetic energy [148]).
In a gauge-invariant Lagrangian this results in terms of order higher than two in the matter and gauge fields, which are interpreted as interactions between the corresponding particles.
In non-abelian gauge theories, like quantum chromodynamics (QCD), there are also terms in the Lagrangian of order higher than two in the gauge fields themselves, coming from a quadratic term in the curvature that appears in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian.

In physics, the quadratic term ``[A_\mu, A_\nu]`` in the expression for ``F_{\mu\nu}`` (leading to cubic and quartic terms in the *Yang-Mills Lagrangian*, see Definition 7.3.1 and the corresponding local formula in Eq. (7.1)) is interpreted as a direct interaction between gauge bosons described by the gauge field ``A_\mu``.
These covariant derivatives appear in physics, in particular, in the Lagrangians and field equations defining gauge theories.
This non-linearity, called *minimal coupling*, leads to non-quadratic terms in the Lagrangian (see Definition 7.5.5 and Definition 7.6.2 as well as the local formulas in Eqs. (7.3) and (7.4)), which are interpreted as an interaction between gauge bosons described by ``A_\mu`` and the particles described by the field ``\phi``.

Figure 5.2 shows the Feynman diagrams for the cubic and quartic terms which appear in the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian in Eq. (7.3), representing the interaction between a gauge field ``A`` and a charged scalar field described locally by a map ``\phi`` with values in ``V``.

Hermitian scalar products are particularly important, because we need them in Chap. 7 to define Lorentz invariant Lagrangians involving spinors.

``<\psi, \phi> \ = \ \overline{\psi} \phi``,

``\overline{\psi} = \psi^\dagger A``.

Dirac forms are used in the Standard Model to define a *Dirac mass term* in the Lagrangian for all fermions (except possibly the neutrinos) and, together with the Dirac operator the *kinetic term* and the *interaction term*; see Sect. 7.6.
